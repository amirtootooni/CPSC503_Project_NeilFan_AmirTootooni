Like Ballard 's earlier short story `` The Dead Time '' ( published in the anthology Myths of the Near Future ) , it is essentially fiction but draws extensively on Ballard 's experiences in World War II . The name of the novel is derived from the etymology of the name for Japan . \n \n Ballard later wrote of his experiences in China as a boy and the making of the film of the same name in his autobiography Miracles of Life . \n \n Plot \n \n The novel recounts the story of a young British boy , Jamie Graham ( named after Ballard 's two first names , `` James Graham '' ) , who lives with his parents in Shanghai . After the Pearl Harbor attack , Japan occupies the Shanghai International Settlement , and in the following chaos Jim becomes separated from his parents . \n \n He spends some time in abandoned mansions , living on remnants of packaged food . Having exhausted the food supplies , he decides to try to surrender to the Japanese Army . After many attempts , he finally succeeds and is interned in the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center . \n \n Although the Japanese are `` officially '' the enemies , Jim identifies partly with them , both because he adores the pilots with their splendid machines and because he feels that Lunghua is still a comparatively safer place for him . \n \n Towards the end of the war , with the Japanese army collapsing , the food supply runs short . Jim barely survives , with people around him starving to death . The camp prisoners are forced upon a march to Nantao , with many dying along the route . Jim then leaves the march and is saved from starvation by air drops from American Bombers . Jim returns to Lunghua camp and finds Dr. Ransome there , soon returning to his pre-war residence with his parents . \n \n Film adaptation \n \n The book was adapted by Tom Stoppard in 1987 . The screenplay was filmed by Steven Spielberg , to critical acclaim , being nominated for six Oscars and winning three British Academy Awards ( for cinematography , music and sound ) . It starred a then 13-year-old Christian Bale , as well as John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson ; it also featured a cameo by a 21-year-old Ben Stiller , in a dramatic role .",

The project began with a budget of only £175 . On 4 October 1983 the car reached a top speed of and broke the record at ( average speed of two runs within one hour ) . This was achieved at the Black Rock Desert in Nevada , USA . It is powered by a single Rolls-Royce Avon jet engine sourced from an English Electric Lightning , and has a configuration somewhat resembling that of the mid-1960s-era J79 turbojet-powered land speed record cars of Art Arfons , collectively known as the `` Green Monster '' cars . \n \n KTVN TV ( Reno , Nevada ) reporter/photographers Michael Hagerty and Gary Martin covered the record setting attempt in the days leading up to the record . The car was unceremoniously stored under a tarp in the only automotive garage at Black Rock desert when it was n't being worked on by the team . A propane torch was used to burn the line straight down the hard cracked dirt of the desert for the driver to follow . No other cars were allowed to approach the race track except on the perpendicular lest the driver accidentally follow those car tracks as a different path through the measured mile . \n \n In 1997 Thrust2 's record was broken by Richard Noble 's follow up car , ThrustSSC . ( Top speed - 1,228 kmph ) \n \n When the car was offered for sale at £90,000 in 1991 , an extensive fundraising campaign was organised without government assistance to keep the car in Britain . The bid was successful , and today Thrust2 and its successor , ThrustSSC , are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry , England .",

          "context": "`` Fire '' is a song written by Jimi Hendrix and recorded by the Jimi Hendrix Experience in early 1967 . It has been described as `` an exercise in soul , psychedelic rock , and polyrhythmic jazz-inspired drumming '' by AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald . The song was remixed in stereo for the American release of the album . In 1969 , it was released as a stereo single in the UK with the title `` Let Me Light Your Fire '' . One of Hendrix 's most popular songs , he frequently played it in concert . Several live recordings have been released and the original song is included on numerous Hendrix compilations , such as Smash Hits , Experience Hendrix : The Best of Jimi Hendrix , Voodoo Child : The Jimi Hendrix Collection , and Fire : The Jimi Hendrix Collection . \n \n Overview \n \n Despite its sexual overtones , the song had an innocuous origin . Noel Redding , bass player for the Experience , invited Hendrix to his mother 's house on a cold New Year 's Eve in Folkestone , England , after a gig . Hendrix asked Noel 's mother if he could stand next to her fireplace to warm himself . She agreed , but her Great Dane was in the way , so Hendrix let out with , `` Aw , move over , Rover , and let Jimi take over '' . Hendrix later joked with the lyric : `` Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard to find her poor dog a bone , but when she bent over Rover took over , 'cause Rover had a bone of his own ! Shakespeare , page 35 ! '' \n \n The Red Hot Chili Peppers covered it on their 1989 album , Mother 's Milk , changing some of the lyrics such as `` Move over , Rover , and let Jimi take over '' to `` Move over , Rover , and let Mr. Huckleberry take over '' as a tribute to the late RHCP guitarist , Hillel Slovak ( who was also known by his nickname , `` Mr. Huckleberry '' ) , who had died months before recording for the Mother 's Milk album began . Kingston Wall covered it on their 1992 debut album I . In 1994 , the accordion-based rock band Those Darn Accordions recorded a version for their 1994 album Squeeze This ! , where it was sung by a then 79-year-old Clyde Forsman , one of the group 's accordionists . Alice Cooper covered it on his 1995 compilation album Classicks . SSQ covered the song as a b-side to their single `` Synthicide '' .",

The airport is operated by the Civil Aviation and Meteorology Bureau of Libya and is the second largest in the country after Tripoli International Airport . Benina International is also the secondary hub of both Buraq Air and flag carrier , Libyan Airlines . As of 17 July 2014 all flights to the airport were suspended due to fighting in the area . \n \n History \n \n During World War II , the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force during the Eastern Desert Campaign . Known as Soluch Airfield , it was used by the 376th Bombardment Group , which flew B-24 Liberator heavy bombers from the airfield between 22 February and 6 April 1943 . Once the combat units moved west , it was used as a logistics hub by Air Transport Command . It functioned as a stopover en route to Payne Field near Cairo or to Mellaha Field near Tripoli on the North African Cairo-Dakar transport route for cargo , transiting aircraft and personnel . \n \n A new terminal with a capacity of 5 million passengers was to be developed north of the existing runway at Benina International under a 720 million LYD ( €415 million ) first-stage contract awarded to Canada 's SNC-Lavalin as of 2008 . The final cost was estimated at 1.1 billion LYD ( €630 million ) . As with Tripoli International Airport , the new terminal was designed by Aéroports de Paris Engineering . Preliminary work and site preparation had started as of May 2008 , but it remains unclear when the terminal will be open for operation . The contract for Benina International Airport included construction of a new international terminal , runway and apron . The new airport would have been part of an extensive new infrastructure programme being undertaken by the government of Libya throughout the country . \n \n In , forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi bombed the airport . No damages were reported to facilities . \n \n The airport has been closed since 16 May 2014 , due to clashes in the area between militias and forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar . As of 1 August 2014 international airlines had suspended all flights to Libya . As of 5 August 2015 the airport was closed to passenger traffic . \n \n Airlines and destinations \n \n Passenger \n \n As of December 2015 , Air Libya operated out of Benina International Airport and operates flights to Tripoli , Alexandria , Kufra and Tunis while Libyan Airlines operates to Amman and Kufra . \n \n Cargo \n \n Accidents and incidents \n \n * On 4 April 1943 , Lady Be Good , a World War II B-24 Liberator based at Soluch Field , missed the airport while returning from a bombing mission in Italy . It crashed in the Libyan Desert 434 miles ( 699 km ) southeast of Soluch Field and was lost for 15 years . \n \n * On 9 August 1958 , a Vickers Viscount registration VP-YNE of Central African Airways crashed 9 kilometres ( 5.6 mi ) south east of Benina International Airport , killing 36 of the 54 people on board .",

It was first recorded By Sammy Ambrose on Musicor # 1061 , then by Gary Lewis & the Playboys on Liberty # 55756 . Lewis 's version charted first , # 101 on the January 2 , 1965 Billboard `` Bubbling Under '' chart . Both versions charted on January 9 , Lewis still at # 101 and Ambrose at # 117 . Ambrose dropped off the charts at that point , but Lewis made # 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the next week ( January 16 ) and his version continued to climb until it reached # 1 on February 20 , 1965 . \n \n Gary Lewis & the Playboys version \n \n None of the Playboys played their instruments on the hit recording and Lewis 's vocals were heavily supported by Ron Hicklin 's overdubs . The music was performed by members of The Wrecking Crew . The session drummer was Hal Blaine , Carol Kaye played bass and Leon Russell both played keyboards and arranged the music . The song was produced by Snuff Garrett . \n \n Stylistically , the song 's recording features the then common `` basic 'combo ' instrumentation ... ( electric guitar , organ , bass , drums ) , modal ( dorian ) inflections in the harmony and melody of the verse and a basic rock beat pattern . '' Unusually the chorus features timpani and the transition between verse and chorus creates a daring modulation from C minor ( dorian ) to G-flat major . \n \n `` The musical style , '' writes Brackett , `` skims aspects from contemporary rock songs , and is then produced and arranged from the vantage point of 'easy-listening ' music . '' The song 's harmonic progression resembles those of Beatles songs such as the G-flat/F/E-flat/D-flat descending bass line ( `` Bad to Me '' ) and the vi-iii movement ( `` Please Please Me , '' `` I Want to Hold Your Hand , '' `` She Loves You , '' `` And I Love Her , '' and others ) . The melodic turn on `` true '' of `` if you find someone whose heart is true '' resembles those in `` Please Please Me '' ( `` Last night I said these words to my girl '' ) and `` Do You Want to Know a Secret '' ( `` nobody knows , just we two '' ) . \n \n Al Kooper has reportedly stated many times that he was unhappy with the record and had originally hoped the song would be recorded by a group like The Drifters based upon the original demo of the song as recorded by Jimmy Radcliffe , although it has been his biggest commercial success as a songwriter . Kooper would later re-visit the song , recording a funky version for his 1976 album `` Act Like Nothing 's Wrong .

His father died in 1914 . His family descended from the Clan MacLaren in Argyll . \n \n Design engineer \n \n Spitfire undercarriage \n \n He invented the Spitfire undercarriage when living in West Drayton , Middlesex when working for Maclaren Undercarriage Company Ltd .

He retired from aeronautical design in 1944 , forming the company Andrews Maclaren and making aircraft components . \n \n Collapsible baby buggy \n \n The former test pilot and designer of the Supermarine Spitfire undercarriage was inspired when his daughter visited from the United States with his first grandchild . After watching the parents struggle with the clumsy conventional pushchair , he used his knowledge of lightweight , collapsible structures to create a new generation of infant transport and inspire the design of future collapsible objects such as the Strida bicycle . \n \n He designed his first buggy in 1965 , which was built in his medieval farmhouse stables in Barby , Northamptonshire in England just south of Rugby . He applied for a patent , on 20 July 1965 , for his 6lb B01 prototype with lightweight aluminium tubes receiving Patent No . 1,154,362 . On 18 July 1966 he filed for an American patent , receiving Patent No . 3,390,893 . \n \n Only after this design would aluminium tubes be used in other household equipment . The buggy went on sale in 1967 . He also designed the 'Gadabout folding chair ' which was produced from 1961 , and was commissioned by the Ministry of Health to design a larger folding buggy for larger children with disabilities called the 'Buggy Major ' this buggy was designed on square tubes instead of the usual round tubes like the 'Baby Buggy ' , being produced around 1970 . \n \n Today the modern version of the 'Baby Buggy ' are sold in over 50 countries under the Maclaren brand based in Long Buckby . \n \n Personal life \n \n He was married to Marie and they had a son and daughter . \n \n In January 1978 Queen Elizabeth II awarded him with an MBE in the New Year 's Honours List . \n \n Notes",

In music notation , the flat symbol , derived from a stylised lowercase `` b '' , lowers a note by a half step ( semitone ) . Intonation or tuning is said to be flat when it is below the true pitch . \n \n Flat accidentals are used in the key signatures of F major/D minor , B-flat major/G minor , E-flat major/C minor , A-flat major/F minor , D-flat major/B-flat minor , and the less frequently used keys of G-flat major/E-flat minor , C-flat major/A-flat minor . The order of flats in the key signatures of music notation , following the circle of fifths , is B , E , A , D , G , C , and F. A mnemonic for this is : Before Eating A Doughnut Get Coffee First . \n \n The Unicode character ♭ ( U+266D ) can be found in the block Miscellaneous Symbols ; its HTML entity is ♭ . \n \n Under twelve tone equal temperament , C-flat for instance is the same as , or enharmonically equivalent to , B-natural ( B ) , and G-flat is the same as F-sharp ( F ) . In any other tuning system , such enharmonic equivalences in general do not exist . To allow extended just intonation , composer Ben Johnston uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents ( ratio 25:24 ) , and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents . \n \n Double flats also exist , which look like ( similar to two flats , ) and lower a note by two semitones , or a whole step . Less often ( for instance in microtonal music notation ) one will encounter half , or three-quarter , or otherwise altered flats . The Unicode character 𝄫 ( U+1D12B ) in the Musical Symbols block represents the double-flat sign . \n \n Although very uncommon and only used in modern classical music , a triple flat ( ) can sometimes be found . It lowers a note three semitones . \n \n A half flat , indicating the use of quarter tones , may be marked with various symbols including a flat with a slash ( ) or a reversed flat sign ( ) .

This cartoon is Huey , Dewey , and Louie 's very first appearance in animation . The short , and the three nephews , was the idea of Al Taliaferro , the artist for the Silly Symphonies comic strip , which featured Donald Duck . The Walt Disney Productions Story Dept . on February 5 , 1937 , sent Taliaferro a memo recognizing him as the source of the idea for the planned short . Taliaferro subsequently introduced the nephews in his comic strip , which by this time had been renamed Donald Duck , on Sunday , October 17 , 1937 , beating the theatrical release of Donald 's Nephews by almost six months . \n \n Plot \n \n Donald receives a postcard from his sister , Dumbella , which says that her three boys , Huey , Dewey , and Louie , are coming to visit him . At first Donald is excited to see his nephews , but soon the boys start causing problems , being a constant annoyance to their uncle . \n \n Donald consults a book entitled Modern Child Training , and tries to use the suggestions to gain control over his nephews , but things only get worse .

It features the Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , who are embroiled in the investigation surrounding the real-life 1888 Whitechapel murders committed by `` Jack the Ripper '' . Christopher Plummer plays Holmes and James Mason plays Watson . Though it features a similar premise , it is notably different in tone and result to A Study in Terror . It is loosely based on The Ripper File by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd . \n \n The film 's premise of the plot behind the murders is influenced by the book , Jack the Ripper : The Final Solution , by Stephen Knight , who presumed that the killings were part of a Masonic plot . The original script contained the names of the historical suspects , Sir William Gull , 1st Baronet and John Netley . In the actual film , they are represented by fictional analogues ; Thomas Spivy ( Gull ) and William Slade ( Netley ) . This plot device was later used in other Jack The Ripper-themed fiction , including the graphic novel From Hell . \n Production \n \n The film was directed by Bob Clark . It stars Christopher Plummer and James Mason as Holmes and Watson , respectively , and presents a largely different version of Holmes from the Rathbone days , with the aesthete still prevailing , yet tinged with a humanity and emotional empathy . James Mason 's Dr. Watson is also a departure from previous incarnations . Although he may appear at first to resemble the bumbling Nigel Bruce version of the character , he soon shows his level head and scientific and medical training to be as valuable assets as they were in the original stories . The supporting cast includes Donald Sutherland , Susan Clark , John Gielgud , Anthony Quayle , David Hemmings and Geneviève Bujold . Frank Finlay plays Inspector Lestrade , a part he had previously portrayed in the similar 1965 film A Study in Terror in which Quayle likewise played a supporting role . Plummer had earlier portrayed Holmes in 1977 's Silver Blaze . \n \n Reception \n \n The film was nominated for 8 Genie Awards in 1980 , of which it won 5 , including Best Achievement in Direction ( Bob Clark ) , Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role ( Geneviève Bujold ) and Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role ( Christopher Plummer ) . \n \n Vincent Canby , writing in the NY Times in February 1979 , gave the film a positive review ; \n \n Cast \n \n * Christopher Plummer ( Sherlock Holmes ) \n * James Mason ( Dr. John Watson ) \n * David Hemmings ( Inspector Foxborough ) \n * Susan Clark ( Mary Kelly ) \n * Frank Finlay ( Inspector Lestrade ) \n * Anthony Quayle ( Sir Charles Warren ) \n * Donald Sutherland ( Robert Lees ) \n * Geneviève Bujold ( Annie Crook ) \n * John Gielgud ( Lord Salisbury , The Prime Minister )",

Longtime cricket historian and scorer , Bill `` Bearders '' Frindall once referred to it online as `` one eye , one arm and one etcetera '' , implying that Nelson 's alleged third lost body part was `` something else '' , however this is equally mythical . In the 1939 film of Goodbye , Mr Chips a schoolboy refers to Nelson in these terms : `` One arm , one eye , one destiny '' . Umpire David Shepherd during a radio interview to mark his retirement explained it as `` One arm , one eye and one lump of sugar in his tea . '' \n \n It is thought by the superstitious that bad things happen on that score , although an investigation by the magazine The Cricketer in the 1990s found that wickets are no more likely to fall on Nelson and indeed , the score at which most wickets fall is 0 ( a duck ) . It may be considered unlucky because the number resembles a wicket without bails ( a batsman is out if the bails are knocked off their wicket ) . \n \n The New Zealand cricket team Nelson played first-class cricket from 1874 to 1891 . In both their first and last first-class innings they were dismissed for 111 . \n \n David Shepherd made popular the longstanding practice of raising a leg or legs from the ground on Nelson in an effort to avoid ill fate . When crowds noticed this , they would cheer his leg-raising . \n \n The equivalent superstitious number in Australian cricket is 87 , or the `` Devil 's Number '' . Many , including commentators and journalists , mistakenly think 87 is considered unlucky because it is thirteen shy of 100 however it came to be known as the `` Devil 's Number '' after Ian Johnson was dismissed for 87 while playing grade cricket and Keith Miller commented `` That 's funny , I once saw Bradman dismissed for 87 '' . It turned out that Bradman had actually been dismissed for 89 and the MCG scorers had n't updated his last two runs before his dismissal however the superstition remained . Statistics have shown that more Australian batsmen are in fact dismissed on the numbers surrounding 87 . \n \n On 11 November 2011 , in a match between South Africa and Australia with the time at 11:11 with South Africa requiring 111 runs to win , the majority of the crowd and umpire Ian Gould did Shepherd 's leg raise Nelson for that minute with the scoreboard reading 11:11 11/11/11 .",

The pair go about this by nominally convincing people to give their spare bedrooms to the homeless , but as their next scheme comes around , `` reversal '' ( being good to people one has not been good to in the past ) , this proves to be fruitless and thus David gives up his strivings and his plans for a book on how to be good , appropriately named `` How to be Good .

Hill ( June 27 , 1859 – June 5 , 1916 ) was an American songwriter and musicologist , who composed the melody for `` Good Morning to All '' , later used as the melody for `` Happy Birthday to You '' . \n \n Biography \n \n Mildred J. Hill , born in Louisville , Kentucky , was the oldest of three sisters , Mildred , Patty , and Jessica . She learned music from her father , Calvin Cody , and Adolph Weidig . \n \n It has been reported that Mildred Hill was a kindergarten and Sunday-school teacher , like her younger sister Patty . Prof. Robert Brauneis , after extensively researching the Hill family , has concluded that she was not a kindergarten teacher . She moved into music , teaching , composing , performing , and specializing in the study of Negro spirituals . Hill and her sister were honored at the Chicago World 's Fair for their work in the progressive education program at the experimental kindergarten , the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School . \n \n She wrote about music using the pen name Johann Tonsor , and her 1892 article `` Negro Music '' , suggesting that the existing body of black music would be the basis of a distinctive American musical style , influenced Dvořák in composing the New World Symphony . \n \n Hill died in Chicago , Illinois , in 1916 , long before her song became famous . She is buried with her sister in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville , Kentucky . \n \n Mildred Hill 's manuscripts and papers are held by the University of Louisville Music Library in Louisville , Kentucky . \n \n `` Happy Birthday to You '' \n \n While teaching at the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School , the Hill sisters wrote the song `` Good Morning to All '' ; Mildred wrote the melody , and Patty the lyrics . The song was first published in 1893 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten as a greeting song for teachers to sing to their students . \n \n `` Happy Birthday to You '' first appeared in print in 1912 using the melody of `` Good Morning to All '' with different lyrics . Its popularity continued to grow through the 1930s , with no author identified for the new lyrics , nor credit given for the melody from `` Good Morning to You '' . Based on 1935 copyright registrations by the Summy Company , and a series of court cases ( which all settled out of court ) , the sisters became known as the authors of `` Happy Birthday to You '' . The Hill Foundation today shares royalties on public performances of the song . However this was brought into question after a judge ruled against the legitimacy of the copyright . \n \n Legacy \n \n Hill and her sister were posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 12 , 1996 .",

The song 's distinctive piano accompaniment , written by Richards , was played on the album by Nicky Hopkins , a Rolling Stones recording-session regular . The strings on the piece ( as well as on another song , `` Winter '' ) were arranged by Nicky Harrison . An unusual feature of the original recording is that singer Mick Jagger 's vocal guide track ( made before the final vocals were performed ) is faintly audible throughout the song ( an effect sometimes called a `` ghost vocal '' ) . \n \n Released as a single in August 1973 , `` Angie '' went straight to the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached No . 5 on the UK singles chart . The song was also a No . 1 hit in both Canada and Australia for five weeks each and topped the charts in many countries throughout Europe and the rest of the world . \n \n Because of the song 's length , some radio stations made edits to shorten it to 3 minutes , omitting the longer coda and the second instrumental section of the song . \n \n There was speculation that the song was about David Bowie 's first wife Angela , the actress Angie Dickinson , Keith Richards ' newborn daughter Dandelion Angela , and others . In 1993 , in an interview for the liner notes to the Rolling Stones ' compilation album Jump Back : The Best of The Rolling Stones , Richards said that the title was inspired by his baby daughter . However , in his 2010 memoir Life , Richards said that he had chosen the name at random when writing the song — before he knew that his baby would be named Angela or even knew that his baby would be a girl — and that the song `` was not about any particular person . '' According to NME , Jagger 's contributions to the lyrics referred to his breakup with Marianne Faithfull . \n \n The Rolling Stones have frequently performed the song in concert ; it was included in set lists on their 1973 , 1975 , and 1976 tours , and they have performed it on every tour since their 1982 European tour . Concert renditions were released on the albums Stripped and Live Licks . \n \n In the documentary Protagonist , the former German terrorist Hans-Joachim Klein remarks that the song inspired him to adopt `` Angie '' as the moniker he used during his militant activities in the 1970s . In 2005 , the German political party CDU used the song in its election campaign for Angela Merkel , although the Rolling Stones had not given them permission to do so . \n \n Music video \n \n Two music videos were shot to promote the song . \n \n Chart performance",

He was shot and killed by Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar public house in Whitechapel , east London . Kray was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder three years later and remained in Broadmoor Hospital until his death in 1995 . \n \n History \n \n Cornell hailed from east London and was originally known as George Myers but had changed his surname some years earlier . Cornell was a tough , loyal enforcer who worked for the Richardson Gang ; he was known for being totally fearless . A childhood friend of the Kray twins , Cornell was a prominent criminal in east London during the 1960s and upon moving to South London joined up with the Kray twins ' rivals , the Richardson Gang , who were brothers Charlie Richardson and Eddie Richardson . \n \n Cornell , along with Richardson gang colleague and friend `` Mad '' Frankie Fraser , became an enforcer for the Richardsons and was primarily used by them for talks with the Krays . Meetings were often held in pubs such as The Grave Maurice . \n \n Death \n \n On 9 March 1966 , Cornell and his friend Albie Woods entered the Blind Beggar pub , ordered some light ales and then sat upon stools next to the bar . At around 8:30pm , both men were approached by Ronnie Kray ; on seeing him , Cornell sneered with sarcasm `` Look who 's here '' . Ronnie Kray walked towards Cornell , took out a 9 mm Luger , and calmly shot him once in the forehead , just above his right eye . \n \n Cornell slumped against a nearby pillar , the bullet , apparently , passing straight through him . He was taken to a nearby hospital , where he died at around 03:30am . \n \n The news spread rapidly . Although Ronnie Kray was identified by several eyewitnesses as he calmly left the public house , no one would agree to testify against him and the police were forced to release him from custody . Cornell was buried in Camberwell New Cemetery , south London . \n \n Old Bailey trial \n \n On 4 March 1969 Ronnie Kray was unanimously found guilty by a jury at The Old Bailey of the murder of George Cornell . His brother Reggie was also found guilty of murdering Jack McVitie , who was killed the year after Cornell . They were both sentenced to life imprisonment . \n \n Ronnie Kray died in jail in March 1995 , while Reggie Kray was imprisoned for a total of 32 years before he was released from custody on compassionate grounds in August 2000 as a result of cancer , from which he died a few weeks after his release .",

The eponymous cartoon character created for the film 's opening credits by David DePatie and Friz Freleng was animated in time to the tune . The tenor saxophone solo was played by Plas Johnson . \n \n The tune was included on the film 's soundtrack album and issued as a single ( in the United States ) in 1964 ; the single reached the Top 10 on the U.S . Billboard adult contemporary chart and won three Grammy Awards . \n \n Various recordings of the tune were featured in the opening credits of all The Pink Panther films , with the exception of A Shot in the Dark and Inspector Clouseau . It has also been used in countless works featuring the animated Pink Panther character . \n \n `` The Pink Panther Theme '' , originally played in the key of E minor , is noted for its quirky , unusual use of chromaticism which is derived from the Hungarian minor scale ( gypsy/romani scale ) with raised 4th and 7th degrees . \n \n Other versions \n \n In the 1978 film Revenge of the Pink Panther , the theme , and much of the soundtrack from this entry in the series , draw heavily from the disco sound of the late 1970s . The theme itself was reworked to include a more dancy bassline , electric piano , and guitar solo . A similar thing was done for 1983 's Curse of the Pink Panther , where it had more electronic sounds incorporated . \n \n The theme was used in John McLaughlin and Al Di Meola 's live version of Chick Corea 's Short Tales of the Black Forest , from the 1981 album Friday Night in San Francisco . \n \n In the 1993 film Son of the Pink Panther , the theme was rearranged and performed by Bobby McFerrin in the opening titles . This version was unique in being the only one to be performed a cappella . \n \n Christophe Beck rearranged the music for the 2006 reboot , as well as its sequel , The Pink Panther 2 . \n Paul Oakenfold remixed the theme song for the 2006 film . \n \n In 2007 , saxophonist Dave Koz recorded a version for his album At the Movies . \n \n The tune was used as background music for `` Safe Crackers , '' one of the pricing games on the CBS game show The Price Is Right , from 1976 until 1992 .",

An aglet keeps the fibers of the lace or cord from unraveling ; its firmness and narrow profile make it easier to hold and easier to feed through the eyelets , lugs , or other lacing guides . \n \n Etymology \n \n The word aglet ( or aiglet ) comes from Old French ; aguillette , which is the diminutive of aguille ( or aiguille ) , meaning needle . The original word for needle in Latin is `` acus '' which is where the word aglet comes from . \n \n Variety \n \n There is a subtle distinction between aglets , which are generally functional , and aiguillettes , which are generally decorative . The latter usually appear at the end of decorative cords , such as bolo ties , and the identically named aiguillettes of military dress uniforms . \n \n Aglets today are most often made of plastic ; they also have been made of metal , glass , and stone . Many were highly ornamental and made of precious metals such as silver . Before the invention of buttons , they were used on the ends of ribbons to fasten clothing together . Sometimes they were formed into small figures . Shakespeare calls this type of figure an `` aglet baby '' in The Taming of the Shrew . \n \n Homemade aglets can be fashioned out of adhesive tape , wax , resin , glue , thread , heat shrink or metal tubing , and by simply knotting or melting the end of a lace or cord .",

They are small trailing ( rather than upright or high-arching ) brambles with aggregate fruits , reminiscent of the raspberry , but are usually purple to black instead of red . Unlike many other Rubus species , dewberries have separate male and female plants ( they are dioecious ) . \n \n Dewberries are common throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere , sometimes thought of as a nuisance weed , but the leaves can be used for a tea , and the berries are sweet and edible . They can be eaten raw , or used to make cobbler , jam , or pie . \n \n Around March and April , the plants start to grow white flowers that develop into small green berries . The tiny green berries grow red and then a deep purple-blue as they ripen . When the berries are ripe , they are tender and difficult to pick in any quantity without squashing them . The plants do not have upright canes like some other Rubus species , but have stems that trail along the ground , putting forth new roots along the length of the stem . The stems are covered with fine spines or stickers . The berries are sweet and , for many , less seedy than blackberries and worth the scratches and stains that come from picking them . \n \n In the winter the leaves often remain on the stems , but may turn dark red . The leaves are sometimes eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including peach blossom moths . \n \n The European dewberry , Rubus caesius , grows more upright like other brambles , but is frequently restricted to coastal communities , especially sand dune systems . Its fruits are a deep , almost black , purple and are coated with a thin layer or 'dew ' of waxy droplets . Thus , they appear sky-blue ( caesius is Latin for pale blue ) . It is less sought after , because its fruits are small and retain a markedly tart taste even when fully ripe . \n \n In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the town of Cameron , North Carolina was known as the `` dewberry capital of the world '' for large scale cultivation of this berry which was shipped out for wide spread consumption .

The term has thus been applied as a name to the speech in its entirety .

Millar had intended the `` you turn if you want to '' line , which preceded it , to be the most popular , and it received an ovation itself , but it was `` the lady 's not for turning '' that received the headlines . At the time , Thatcher was already being referred to as the `` Iron Lady '' . \n \n The speech as a whole was very warmly received at the conference , and received a five-minute standing ovation . \n \n Excerpt",

Zeebrugge serves as both the international port of Bruges-Zeebrugge and a seafront resort with hotels , cafés , a marina and a beach . \n \n Location \n \n Located on the coast of the North Sea , its central location on the Belgian coast , short distance to Great Britain and close vicinity to densely populated industrialised cities make Zeebrugge a crossroads for traffic from all directions . An expressway to Bruges connects Zeebrugge to the European motorway system ; one can also get to and from Zeebrugge by train or tram . \n \n It is Belgium 's most important fishing port and the wholesale fish market located there is one of the largest in Europe . \n \n Aside from being a passenger terminal with ferries to the United Kingdom , the harbour serves as the central port for Europe 's automotive industry , and it is important for the import , handling and storage of energy products , agriculture products and other general cargo . Zeebrugge has the largest LNG terminal complex in Europe . \n \n History \n \n The harbour was the site of the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918 , when the British Royal Navy temporarily put the German inland naval base at Bruges out of action . Admiral Roger Keyes planned and led the raid that stormed the German batteries and sank three old warships at the entrance to the canal leading to the inland port . This action blocked access to the port and prevented U-boats and other shipping from using it . The raid , although a morale boosting victory in Britain , was only a partial military success . \n \n Later , Zeebrugge 's harbour was the scene of disaster when in 1987 the MS Herald of Free Enterprise passenger ferry capsized killing 193 people . \n \n Passenger ferry routes \n \n * P & O Ferries to Hull , United Kingdom \n * Zeebrugge - Rosyth ferry service operated by Norfolkline to Rosyth , United Kingdom ( from May 2009 ) ( This service ended on 15 December 2010 )",

It is so named because of the resemblance to the color and taste of iced tea . A popular version mixes equal parts vodka , gin , tequila , rum , and triple sec with 1½ parts sour mix and a splash of cola . \n \n Most variants use equal parts of the main liquors , but include a smaller amount of triple sec ( or other orange-flavored liqueur ) . Close variants often replace the sour mix with lemon juice , replace the cola with diet cola or actual iced tea , or add white crème de menthe ; however , most variants do not include any tea . Some restaurants substitute brandy for the tequila . \n \n The drink has a much higher alcohol concentration ( approximately 22 percent ) than most highball drinks due to the relatively small amount of mixer . Long islands can be ordered `` extra long '' , which further increases the alcohol to mixer ratio . \n \n Origin \n \n There is some dispute as to the origin of the Long Island Iced Tea . However , numerous sources attribute the origin to one or both of two inventors in the 1920s or 1970s . The Long Island Iced Tea appears in literature as early as 1961 . \n \n Alternatively , a slightly different drink is claimed to have been invented in the 1920s during Prohibition in the United States , by an `` Old Man Bishop '' in a local community named Long Island in Kingsport , Tennessee . The drink was then perfected by Ransom Bishop , Old Man Bishop 's son . This drink included whiskey and maple syrup , and varied quantities of the five liquors , rather than the modern one with cola and five equal portions of the five liquors . \n \n Robert `` Rosebud '' Butt claims to have invented the drink as an entry in a contest to create a new mixed drink including Triple Sec , in 1972 while he worked at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island , New York . Various local New York references echo Butt 's claims . Local rumors also ascribe the origin to either Butt or another bartender at the Oak Beach Inn , Chris Bendicksen .",

The character of Simple Simon may have been in circulation much longer , possibly appearing in an Elizabethan chapbook and in a ballad , Simple Simon 's Misfortunes and his Wife Margery 's Cruelty , from about 1685 . Another possible inspiration was Simon Edy , a beggar in the St Giles area in the 18th century . \n \n In popular culture \n \n * Laurel and Hardy `` played '' , respectively , Simple Simon and the pieman in Walt Disney 's animated short , Mother Goose Goes Hollywood . \n * Simple Simon also appeared in the 1933 Disney cartoon Old King Cole . \n * Simple Simon was played by Charley Rogers in Babes in Toyland ( 1934 film ) . \n * In the 1936 Merrie Melodies cartoon I Love to Singa , during the amateur hour segment , the country bumpkin bird ( voiced by Joe Dougherty , who was the original voice of Porky Pig ) stuttered through the first and almost all of the second verse of Simple Simon before rejecting himself . \n * The Three Stooges did a variant version , which began the usual way , and ended : \n \n Said the pieman to Simple Simon , \n `` Show me first your penny . '' \n Said Simple Simon to the pieman , \n `` Scram ! Ya do n't get any ! '' \n \n ( And a pie in the face ) \n \n * Another variant of the nursery rhyme was an animated film on Sesame Street . \n * In the film `` Die Hard with a Vengeance '' ( 1995 ) , the film 's antagonist , Simon Peter Gruber ( Jeremy Irons ) , reads the beginning of the poem to John McClane 's ( Bruce Willis ) boss , Inspector Walter Cobb ( Larry Bryggman ) . \n * In a Bullwinkle 's Corner segment of the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show , while performing Simple Simon , Bullwinkle and Boris Badenov change into a version of Abbott and Costello 's Who 's on First sketch . \n * An image of Simple Simon is discussed in Stephen King 's novel Needful Things . \n * Simple Simon is mentioned as a character in the video game The Wolf Among Us . \n * The poem is referenced in The Simpsons episode `` Simple Simpson '' which features Homer Simpson disguising himself as a superhero called `` the Pie Man .

The `` box '' was actually a large jar ( πίθος pithos ) given to Pandora ( Πανδώρα , `` all-gifted '' , `` all-giving '' ) , which contained all the evils of the world . Pandora opened the jar and all the evils flew out , leaving only `` Hope '' inside once she had closed it again . \n \n Today the phrase `` to open Pandora 's box '' means to perform an action that may seem small or innocent , but that turns out to have severely detrimental and far-reaching negative consequences . \n \n In mythology \n \n In classical Greek mythology , Pandora was the first woman on Earth . Zeus ordered Hephaestus to create her . So he did , using water and earth . The gods endowed her with many gifts : Athena clothed her , Aphrodite gave her beauty , Apollo gave her musical ability , and Hermes gave her speech . \n \n According to Hesiod , when Prometheus stole fire from heaven , Zeus took vengeance by presenting Pandora to Prometheus ' brother Epimetheus . Pandora opens a jar containing death and many other evils which were released into the world . She hastened to close the container , but the whole contents had escaped except for one thing that lay at the bottom – Elpis ( usually translated `` Hope '' , though it could also mean `` Expectation '' ) . \n \n Etymology of the `` box '' \n \n The original Greek word was 'pithos ' , which is a large jar , sometimes as large as a small person ( Diogenes of Sinope was said to have slept in one ) . It was used for storage of wine , oil , grain or other provisions , or , ritually , as a container for a human body for burying . In the case of Pandora , this jar may have been made of clay for use as storage as in the usual sense , or of metal , such as bronze , as an unbreakable prison . \n \n The mistranslation of pithos is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam who translated Hesiod 's tale of Pandora into Latin . Erasmus rendered pithos as the Greek pyxis , meaning `` box '' . The phrase `` Pandora 's box '' has endured ever since . This misconception was further reinforced by Dante Gabriel Rossetti 's painting Pandora . \n \n Pandora in art \n \n See also Category : Pandora at Wikimedia Commons . \n \n File : Pandora-1879.jpg|Rosetti 's Pandora ( 1879 ) \n File : Pandora - John William Waterhouse.jpg|Waterhouse 's , Pandora , 1896 ) \n File : Alaux , Jean - Pandora carried off by Mercury.jpg|Jean Alaux , Pandora carried off by Mercury , 18th or 19th century \n File : Pandora opening her box by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon by James Gillray , employing the image of Pandora .",

The Spanish forces at that battle included British Royalist Regiments : The ( English ) King 's Guards ( foot ) under Wentworth ; A Scottish Regiment under Newburgh ; The Marquis of Ormond 's ( Irish ) Regiment under Richard Grace ; The Duke of York 's ( Irish ) Regiment under Muskerry ; The Duke of Gloucester 's ( Irish ) Regiment under Taaffe ; and Farrell 's ( Irish ) Regiment under Lisagh Farrell . These regiments ( except , perhaps , Ormond 's ) were seriously under-strength , and were all under the overall command of James , Duke of York . There was also a small contingent of James ' own Life Guards . The English part of the Anglo-French force included regiments under William Lockhart , Thomas Morgan , Roger Alsop , Samuel Clark , Bryce Cochrane and Roger Lillingston . \n \n France ( effectively ruled by Mazarin ) had promised - as part of the Treaty of Paris ( 1657 ) - that Dunkirk and Mardyke , then in the Spanish Netherlands , would be ceded to England . Mazarin honoured that pledge after the victory at The Dunes , and Louis XIV himself delivered Dunkirk over to Lockhart ( who was Cromwell 's Ambassador to France ) on or about 24 June 1658 . Cromwell appointed Lockhart Governor of the town . Lockhart 's regiment ( much reduced in the battle ) and Alsop 's garrisoned Dunkirk and Mardyke ( taken in 1657 ) , reinforced by Salmon 's and Gibbon 's regiments from England , while Morgan 's , Clark 's , Cochrane 's and Lillingston 's continued to serve with the French Army in Flanders . The Royalist regiments , even more reduced by the defeat , continued to serve with Spain . In early 1659 , most of Salmon 's regiment was sent back to England , as was Gibbon 's , and three regiments of the Protectorate force ( Morgan 's , Clark 's , Cochrane 's ) returned to England in August 1959 in response to ( planned , but discovered ) Royalist uprisings culminating in Booth 's uprising . \n \n The Treaty of the Pyrenees in November 1659 confirmed English possession of Dunkirk . \n \n possession of the territory then passed to Charles following the Restoration in 1660 . The merchant Edward Blackwell , who served as Treasurer of Dunkirk under both the Republican and Royal governments , was instrumental in the sale . \n \n Since 1660 Dunkirk had been garrisoned by an uneasy mixture of English former New Model Army troops of republican sympathies and several Royalist regiments who had served under Charles in exile , which included many Irish Catholics . Many of the garrison of Dunkirk were shipped to English Tangier , which had recently been acquired as part of the Marriage Treaty with Portugal where they formed most of the initial Tangier Garrison .",

Three of the seven Constitutionalists elected , including Winston Churchill , had been opposed by official Liberal candidates , and sat as Conservatives after the election . The other four sat as Liberals . \n \n The Conservative landslide victory and the Labour defeat in this general election has been , in part , attributed to the Zinoviev letter , a forgery , which was published in the Daily Mail four days before the election . However , it is difficult to prove that this had a major impact on the election result . The Labour vote increased by around one million popular votes in comparison to the 1923 general election , however , the increase in the number of popular votes for the Labour Party may be due , in part , to the party putting up eighty-seven more candidates than it did in the previous year 's general election . \n \n It is widely speculated that the combination of Labour forming its first government in January 1924 and the Zinoviev letter helped to stir up anti-socialist fears in Britain among many traditional anti-socialist Liberal voters , who then switched their support to the Conservative Party . This partly helps to explain the poor performance of the Liberal Party in the general election .

A clinical sign or condition that constitutes insufficient tear film drainage from the eyes in that tears will drain down the face rather than through the nasolacrimal system . [ http : //www.revoptom.com/handbook/sect1i.htm Handbook of Ocular Disease Management - Chronic Epiphora ] \n \n Etiology \n \n Causes of epiphora include ocular irritation and inflammation ( including trichiasis and entropion ) or an obstructed tear outflow tract which is divided according to its anatomical location ( i.e . ectropion , punctal , canalicular or nasolacrimal duct obstruction ) . The latter is often due to aging ( a spontaneous process ) , conjunctivochalasis , infection ( i.e . dacryocystitis ) , rhinitis , and in neonates or infants , failure of the nasolacrimal duct to open . Another cause could be poor reconstruction of the nasolacrimal duct system after trauma to the area . Cause of trauma could be facial fractures ( including nasoethmoid fractures or maxillary Le Fort fractures ) , and soft tissue trauma involving the nose and/or the eyelid . \n This condition is often frustrating or irritating . A systematic review studying the usage of punctal plugs for treatment of keratoconjunctivitis sicca reported a few cases of epiphora among participants . \n \n Diagnosis \n \n Diagnosis of epiphora is clinical by history presentation and observation of the lids . Fluorescein dye can be used to examine for punctal reflux by pressing on the canaliculi in which the clinician should note resistance of reflux as it irrigates through the punctum into the nose . \n \n Management \n \n If epiphora is caused by ectropion or entropion , lid repair is indicated . Punctal irrigation is also required . In infants with nasolacrimal defects , a nasolacrimal duct probe is used and a tube replacement , either temporary ( Crawford ) or permanent ( Jones ) , is carried out . A surgical procedure called a dacryocystorhinostomy is done to join the lacrimal sac to the nasal mucosa in order to restore lacrimal drainage .",

The plot focuses on a young Parisian girl being groomed for a career as a courtesan and her relationship with the wealthy cultured man named Gaston who falls in love with her and eventually marries her . \n \n The novella was the basis for a 1949 French film starring Danièle Delorme and Gaby Morlay . \n \n In 1951 , it was adapted for the stage by Anita Loos . Colette had personally picked the yet unknown Audrey Hepburn on first sight to play the title role . Her Aunt Alicia was played by stage legend Cathleen Nesbitt , who was to become Hepburn 's acting mentor from that time on . Opening on 24 November 1951 on Broadway at the Fulton Theatre , the play ran for 219 performances ( finishing on 31 May 1952 ) and Hepburn 's debut on Broadway earned her a Theatre World Award . \n \n The novella was translated into English by Roger Senhouse and published ( with `` The Cat '' translated by Antonia White ) in 1953 . \n \n Seven years later , a musical film version with a screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner and a score by Lerner and Frederick Loewe won the Academy Award for Best Picture . This film version starred Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan . The story of a girl being groomed to be a courtesan by her grandmother made producer Arthur Freed doubt whether making it as a straight drama would be acceptable to the American censors , so they `` cleaned it up '' and turned it into a musical . \n \n Lerner and Loewe adapted the film for a 1973 stage musical that proved to be unsuccessful . \n \n A pre-Broadway production of the musical , newly adapted by Heidi Thomas ( Call the Midwife , Cranford , Upstairs Downstairs ) and directed by Eric D. Schaeffer ( Follies , Million Dollar Quartet ) was performed at Washington D.C 's Kennedy Center till mid February 2015 with High School Musical actress Vanessa Anne Hudgens playing as Gigi . \n This revival of Gigi opened on Broadway , at the Neil Simon Theater , on April 8 , 2015 .",

The term mukluk is often used for any soft boot designed for cold weather and modern designs are often similar to high-top athletic shoes . The word `` mukluk '' is of Yupik origin , from maklak , the bearded seal , while `` kamik '' is an Inuit word . In the Inuipiaq language the `` u '' makes an `` oo '' sound , and so the spelling `` maklak '' is used with the same pronunciation . \n \n Another type of boot , sometimes called an Inuit boot , originating in Greenland and the eastern part of Alaska , are made by binding them with animal cartilage and have a centre seam running down to the foot of the boot . \n \n Mukluks weigh little and allow hunters to move very quietly . They may be adorned with pompons and beads and may be lined with furs such as rabbit , fox and raccoon . \n \n The design of the mukluk is used for the industrial manufacture of cold-weather boots , especially paired with a rugged contemporary sole . The key component of its success is its ability to breathe , that is , to allow air exchange . This is an advantage in extremely cold conditions where perspiration may become a factor in frostbite on one 's feet . The bulkiness paired with their poor performance in slush makes them less ideal for the casual winter wearer . \n \n Another kind of mukluk , typically made out of wool or a wool-rayon blend , is knitted with a soft leather sole . Often called `` Slipper Socks '' , these were the traditional mukluk worn by the people of the Hindu Kush Mountains .",

In England in around 1300 , various different `` hundreds '' ( centem in Medieval Latin ) were defined . The Weights and Measures Act of 1835 formally established the present imperial hundredweight of 112 lb . The use in trade of measures by `` cental '' , `` hundredweight '' , or `` quintal '' have now been banned in the United Kingdom under the Weights and Measures Act of 1985 . \n \n The United States and Canada came to use the term `` hundredweight '' to refer to a unit of 100 lb . This measure was specifically banned from British use—upon risk of being sued for fraud—by the Weights and Measures Act of 1824 but , in 1879 , the measure was legalized under the name `` cental '' in response to legislative pressure from British merchants importing wheat and tobacco from the United States . \n \n Use \n \n The short hundredweight is commonly used in the US in the sale of livestock and some cereal grains and oilseeds , paper , and concrete additives and on some commodities in futures exchanges \n \n A few decades ago , commodities weighed in terms of long hundredweight included cattle , cattle fodder , fertilizers , coal , some industrial chemicals , other industrial materials , and so on . However , since increasing metrication in most English-speaking countries , it is now less used . Church bell ringers use the unit commonly , although church bell manufacturers are increasingly moving over to the metric system . \n \n Older blacksmiths ' anvils are often stamped with a three-digit number indicating their total weight in hundredweight , quarter-hundredweight ( 28 lb ) , and pounds . Thus , an anvil stamped `` 1.1.8 '' will weigh 148 lb ( 112 lb + 28 lb + 8 lb ) .",

The outside of the cap is entirely covered in real ( e.g . seal skin or Persian lamb ) or synthetic fur and is shaped like a wedge . When not being worn the cap folds flat . The cap is about 8 in high but is normally worn with the apex of the wedge shape depressed back into the interior of the cap to form a longitudinal trough at the crown , reducing the overall height . Often the cap is patterned such that the front of the crown will be slightly higher than the back . On one side of the military style fur wedge cap hangs a flat flap made of cloth or wool that extends from the crown to the bottom of the cap , known as the 'bag ' . The colour of the 'bag ' was determined by the regimental colours ( e.g . the RCMP bag was yellow ) . The bag is very similar to that worn with the busby . Because of the cap 's passing resemblance to the hussar busby author and researcher James J. Boulton dubbed it the envelope busby . Still , whatever influence the busby may have had on its design , the fur wedge cap pattern was `` distinctly Canadian '' \n \n The fur wedge cap was used by both the North-West Mounted Police ( NWMP ) , later Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) , with the first examples coming into service in 1876 until 1901 and then again from 1928 until 1935 . Today the RCMP wear the Yukon pattern of fur cap that is similar to the Russian ushanka style . The other police unit that still regularly wears the fur wedge cap is the Toronto Police Mounted Unit as part of their full dress uniform . The Canadian military also wore the cap from about the end of the 19th century , and was formally adopted in the 1970s as the issued fur cap for all commands of the Canadian Forces during unification . The bag was coloured rifle green . In Canadian Forces nomenclature it is known as Cap , Man ’ s Winter , Fur , C.F . Exactly when the fur cap stopped being in general issue is unclear ; however , it is still being worn today by the officer cadets of the Royal Military College of Canada . As an example William Avery Bishop , Canadian flying ace , can be seen wearing the cap during his days in Royal Military College of Canada . \n \n In popular culture \n \n The fur wedge cap is prominently featured in the Cecil B. DeMille film North West Mounted Police ( 1940 ) , with the mounted police characters all wearing the cap despite the fact that the movie is set in the summer time . ( In real usage , the cap was not intended to be worn in summer . ) \n \n A civilian version of the cap without the bag was fashionable in Canada during the 1970s .",

The word derives from the Greek ( ) meaning `` dung , feces '' ; coprology derives from the Greek of similar meaning . \n \n A comprehensive study of scatology was documented by John Gregory Bourke under the title Rites of All Nations ( 1891 ) . An abbreviated version of the work ( with a foreword by Sigmund Freud ) , was published as The Portable Scatalog in 1994 . \n \n Psychology \n \n In psychology , a scatology is an obsession with excretion or excrement , or the study of such obsessions .

Entire subcultures in sexuality are devoted to this fetish . \n \n Literature \n \n In literature , `` scatological '' is a term to denote the literary trope of the grotesque body . It is used to describe works that make particular reference to excretion or excrement , as well as to toilet humor . A common example is John Dryden 's MacFlecknoe , a poem that ridicules Dryden 's contemporary , Thomas Shadwell . Dryden refers to him as `` Thomas Sh -- , '' deliberately evoking scatological imagery . In German literature in particular is a wealth of scatological texts and references , which includes such books as Collofino 's Non Olet . A case which has provoked an unusual amount of comment in the academic literature is Mozart 's scatological humour . Smith , in his review of English literature 's representations of scatology from the Middle Ages to the 18th century notes two attitudes towards scatology . One of these emphasises the merry and the carnivalesque . This is found in Chaucer and Shakespeare . The other attitude is one of self-disgust and misanthropy .

A lambic is a sour and dry Belgian beer , fermented spontaneously with airborne yeast said to be native to Brussels ; the presence of cherries ( or raspberries ) predates the almost universal use of hops as a flavoring in beer . \n A traditional kriek made from a lambic base beer is sour and dry as well . The cherries are left in for a period of several months , causing a refermentation of the additional sugar . Typically no sugar will be left so there will be a fruit flavour without sweetness . There will be a further maturation process after the cherries are removed . \n \n More recently , some lambic brewers have added sugar to the final product of their fruit beers , in order to make them less intense and more approachable to a wider audience . They also use cherry juice rather than whole cherries and are matured for much shorter periods . \n \n Framboise or Frambozenbier is a related , less traditional Belgian beer , fermented with raspberries instead of sour cherries . Kriek is also related to geuze , which is not a fruit beer but is also based on refermented lambic beer . Some breweries , like Liefmans , make `` kriek '' beers based on oud bruin beer instead of lambic . \n \n Commercial examples \n \n Traditional krieks include : \n \n * Boon Kriek \n * Cantillon Kriek Lambic \n * 3 Fonteinen Kriek \n * Girardin Kriek 1882 \n * Hanssens Kriek Lambic \n * Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille \n * Timmermans Traditional Kriek Lambic \n \n Sweetened krieks include : \n \n * Belle-Vue Kriek Lambic \n * Chapeau Kriek Lambic \n * Lindemans Kriek Lambic \n * Mort Subite Kriek Lambic \n * Timmermans Kriek Lambic \n * Van Honsebrouck St. Louis Kriek Lambic \n * La Sultane Halal Kriek \n \n Kriek based on Oud Bruin include : \n \n * De Ryck Kriek Fantastiek \n * Liefmans Kriek \n * Kasteel Kriek \n * Verhaeghe Echt Kriekenbier",

          "context": "Borscht is a tart soup popular in several East European cuisines , including Ukrainian , Russian , Polish , Belarusian , Lithuanian , Romanian and Ashkenazi Jewish . The variety most commonly associated with the name in English is of Ukrainian origin and includes beetroots as one of the main ingredients , which gives the dish a distinctive red color . It shares the name , however , with a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots , such as sorrel-based green borscht , rye-based white borscht , cabbage borscht , etc . \n \n Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems , leaves and umbels of common hogweed , a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows , which lent the dish its Slavic name . With time , it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups , among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular . It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables , which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage , carrots , onions , potatoes and tomatoes . Depending on the recipe , borscht may include meat or fish , or be purely vegetarian ; it may be served either hot or cold ; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a dainty clear broth or a smooth refreshing drink . It is often served with smetana or sour cream , hard-boiled eggs and/or potatoes , but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes , such as ' or ' , that can be served with the soup . \n \n Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire , and – by way of migration – to other continents . In North America , borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites , the groups who first brought it there from Europe . Today , several ethnic groups claim borscht , in its variegated local guises , as their own national dish and consume it as part of ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox , Greek Catholic , Roman Catholic , and Jewish religious traditions . \n \n Etymology \n \n The English word borscht , also spelled borsch , borsht , or bortsch , comes from Yiddish ( ' ) . The latter derives from the word ( ' ) , which is common to East Slavic languages , such as Ukrainian or Russian . Together with cognates in other Slavic languages , it comes from Proto-Slavic * bŭrščǐ 'hogweed ' and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European * bhr̥sti- Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead , yet Borshchland lives on . Recipes , like birds , ignore political boundaries ... The faint outline of the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock , and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup , from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and , in emigration , from Brooklyn to Berlin .",

The rank of lance-bombardier is the artillery counterpart of lance-corporal . \n \n British and Commonwealth armies \n \n Bombardier ( Bdr ) and lance-bombardier ( LBdr or L/Bdr ) are used by the British Army in the Royal Artillery and Royal Horse Artillery . The same applies to the Royal Australian Artillery , the Royal New Zealand Artillery , the South African Army Artillery and the Armed Forces of Malta . The Royal Canadian Artillery uses the ranks of master bombardier and bombardier , corresponding to master corporal and corporal . In the Australian Army the insignia is identical to that of a corporal , the only distinguishing featuring being the RAA badge worn on the cap by lance bombardiers and bombardiers . \n \n Originally , the Royal Artillery had corporals , but not lance-corporals . Unlike a lance-corporal , a bombardier held full non-commissioned rank and not an acting appointment . The rank was equivalent to second corporal in the Royal Engineers and Army Ordnance Corps . \n \n In 1920 corporals were abolished in the Royal Artillery ; bombardiers became the equivalent and acquired the normal two chevrons . \n \n The rank of lance bombardier originated as acting bombardier , an appointment similar to lance-corporal and was also indicated by a single chevron . The appointment was renamed lance-bombardier in February 1918 and became a full rank , as did lance-corporal , in 1961 . \n \n `` Bomb '' is widely used as an informal form of address for both full bombardiers and lance-bombardiers . They may also be referred to as a `` full screw '' ( bombardier ) or a `` lance jack '' ( lance-bombardier ) , in common with corporals and lance-corporals . As with other common military abbreviations , such as `` sarnt '' , these terms are not used on formal occasions . \n \n United States of America \n \n Until the advent of smart bombs and guided missiles , bomber aircraft carried crew members responsible for aiming bombs .

Chatterton 's book Modern Cookery published in 1943 : `` Afternoon tea scones… Time : 20 minutes . Temperature : Gas , Regulo Mark 7 '' . `` Regulo '' was a type of gas regulator used by a manufacturer of cookers ; however , the scale has now become universal , and the word Regulo is rarely used . \n \n The term `` gas mark '' was a subject of the joint BBC/OED TV series Balderdash & Piffle , in May 2005 , which sought to establish the history of the term . The earliest printed evidence of use of `` gas mark '' ( with no other terms between the two words ) appears to date from 1958 . However , the manufacturers of the `` New World '' gas ranges in the mid-1930s gave away recipe books for use with their cooker , and the `` Regulo '' was the gas regulator . The book has no reference to degrees , either in Fahrenheit ( as then ) or Centigrade . All dishes to be cooked are noted to be at `` Regulo Mark X '' . \n \n Equivalents in Fahrenheit and Celsius \n \n Gas mark 1 is 275 °Fahrenheit ( 135 °Celsius ) . \n Oven temperatures increase by 25 °F ( 13.9 °C ) each time the gas mark increases by 1 . Below Gas Mark 1 the scale markings halve at each step , each representing a decrease of 25 °F . \n \n To convert gas mark to degrees Celsius ( D ) , multiply the gas mark number ( G ) by 14 , then add 121 \n \n ( G × 14 ) + 121 = D \n \n For the reverse conversion , G = ( D - 121 ) /14 \n \n ( These do not work for G less than 1 . ) \n \n However it is usual to round the result of this calculation to a round number of degrees Celsius . \n \n ( Appropriate references can found in the section above . ) \n \n Note that tables of temperature equivalents for kitchen use usually offer Celsius values rounded to the nearest 10 degrees , with steps of either 10 or 20 degrees between Gas Marks . \n \n Other cooking temperature scales \n \n French ovens and recipes often use a scale based on the Fahrenheit scale : `` Thermostat '' ( abbreviated `` Th '' ) , where Thermostat 1 equals 100 °F for conventional ovens , increasing by 50 °F for each whole number along the scale . \n \n In Germany , `` Stufe '' ( the German word for `` step '' ) is used for gas cooking temperatures . Gas ovens are commonly marked in steps from 1 to 8 , corresponding to : \n \n Other ovens may be marked on a scale of 1-7 , where Stufe ½ is about 125 °C in a conventional oven , Stufe 1 is about 150 °C , increasing by 25 °C for each subsequent step , up to Stufe 7 at 300 °C .",

Meibum prevents tear spillage onto the cheek , trapping tears between the oiled edge and the eyeball , and makes the closed lids airtight . There are approximately 50 glands on the upper eyelids and 25 glands on the lower eyelids . \n \n Dysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes , one of the more common eye conditions .

Lipids are universally recognized as major components of human and animal meibum . Recently , an update on the composition of human meibum and on the structures of various positively identified meibomian lipids was published . \n \n Currently , the most sensitive and informative approach to lipidomic analysis of meibum is mass spectrometry in combination with liquid chromatography . \n \n Proteins \n \n In humans , more than 90 different proteins have been identified in meibomian gland secretions . \n \n Clinical significance \n \n Dysfunctional meibomian glands often cause dry eyes , one of the more common eye conditions . They may also contribute to blepharitis . Inflammation of the meibomian glands ( also known as meibomitis , meibomian gland dysfunction , or posterior blepharitis ) causes the glands to be obstructed by thick waxy secretions . Besides leading to dry eyes , the obstructions can be degraded by bacterial lipases , resulting in the formation of free fatty acids , which irritate the eyes and sometimes cause punctate keratopathy . \n \n Meibomian gland dysfunction is more often seen in women and is regarded as the main cause of dry eye disease . Factors that contribute to meibomian gland dysfunction can include things such as a person 's age and/or hormones . Treatment can include warm compresses or expression of the gland by a professional . In some cases antibiotics or steroids are prescribed . \n \n History \n \n The glands are named after Heinrich Meibom ( 1638–1700 ) , a German physician .",

It is located in Puck County of the Pomeranian Voivodeship . \n \n Geography \n \n The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata , through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip . Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand , it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms . Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer . \n \n A road and a railroad run along the peninsula from the mainland to the town located at the furthest point , Hel , a popular tourist destination . Other towns , ports , and tourist resorts are Jurata , Jastarnia , Kuźnica , Chałupy , and Władysławowo . \n \n Military importance \n \n The Hel ( German : Hela ) Peninsula was part of Prussia and then Germany from 1772 until 1919 . After the peninsula became part of the Second Polish Republic after World War I , it acquired considerable military significance , and was turned into a fortified region , with a garrison of about 3,000 . In the course of the Battle of Hel in 1939 , Polish forces dynamited the peninsula at one point , turning it into an island . \n \n During the years of German occupation ( 1939–1945 ) , Hel 's defenses were further expanded , and a battery of three 40.6 cm SK C/34 gun was constructed , though the guns were soon moved to the Atlantic Wall in occupied France . The peninsula remained in German hands until the end of World War II , when the defending forces surrendered on May 14 , 1945 , six days after Germany had capitulated . \n \n After the war , when Hel again became part of Poland , it continued to have military significance , with much of its area reserved for military use . Additional gun batteries were built during the 1940s and 1950s . Today many of the fortifications and batteries are open to tourists , though some areas of the peninsula still belong to the Polish Armed Forces . \n \n Cultural references \n \n During an episode of the cartoon Metalocalypse , members of the band Dethklok perform a concert near the Hel Peninsula , the episode states they play the concert `` near Danzig .

          "context": "Raclette is a semi-hard cow 's milk cheese that is usually fashioned into a wheel of about 6 kg ( 13 lb ) . It is most commonly used for melting . It is also a Swiss dish based on heating the cheese and scraping off ( racler ) the melted part . \n \n History \n \n Raclette was mentioned in medieval writings , in texts from Swiss-German convents dating from as far as 1291 , as a particularly nutritious meal consumed by peasants in mountainous Switzerland and Savoy ( Now part of France ) . It was then known in the German-speaking part of Switzerland as Bratchäs , or `` roasted cheese . '' Traditionally , Swiss cow herders used to take the cheese with them when they were moving cows to or from the pastures up in the mountains . In the evenings around the campfire , they would place the cheese next to the fire and , when it had reached the perfect softness , scrape it on top of bread . \n \n In the Swiss canton of Valais , raclette is typically served with tea or other warm beverages . Another popular option is to serve raclette with white wine , such as the traditional Savoy wine or Fendant , but Riesling and Pinot gris are also common . Local tradition cautions that other drinks – water for example – will cause the cheese to harden in the stomach , leading to indigestion . \n \n Dish \n \n Raclette is also a dish indigenous to parts of Switzerland . The raclette cheese round is heated , either in front of a fire or by a special machine , then scraped onto diners ' plates ; the term raclette derives from the French word racler , meaning `` to scrape , '' a reference to the fact that the melted cheese must be scraped from the unmelted part of the cheese onto the plate . \n \n Traditionally the melting happens in front of an open fire with the big piece of cheese facing the heat . One then regularly scrapes off the melting side . It is accompanied by small firm potatoes ( Bintje , Charlotte or Raclette varieties ) , gherkins , pickled onions , and dried meat , such as jambon cru/cuit and viande des Grisons , and to drink , Kirsch , herbal tea or Fendant ( wine from the Chasselas grape ) . \n \n A modern way of serving raclette involves an electric table-top grill with small pans , known as coupelles , in which to melt slices of raclette cheese . Generally the grill is surmounted by a hot plate or griddle . The cheese is brought to the table sliced , accompanied by platters of boiled or steamed potatoes , other vegetables and charcuterie . These are then mixed with potatoes and topped with cheese in the small , wedge-shaped coupelles that are placed under the grill to melt and brown the cheese . Alternatively , slices of cheese may be melted and simply poured over food on the plate . The emphasis in raclette dining is on relaxed and sociable eating and drinking , the meal often running to several hours . French and other European supermarkets generally stock both the grill apparatus and ready-sliced cheese and charcuterie selections , especially around Christmas . Restaurants also provide raclette evenings for parties of diners .",

          "context": "Tilsit cheese or Tilsiter cheese is a light yellow semihard smear-ripened cheese , created in the mid-19th century by Prussian-Swiss settlers , the Westphal family , from the Emmental valley . The original buildings from the cheese plant still exist in Sovetsk , Russia , formerly Tilsit , on the Neman River in the former German province of East Prussia . \n \n The same ingredients to make the cheese were not available as in their home country , and the cheese became colonized by different moulds , yeasts , and bacteria in the humid climate . The result was a cheese that was more intense and full-flavoured . The settlers named the cheese after Tilsit , the Prussian town where they had settled . \n \n Tilsiter has a medium-firm texture with irregular holes or cracks . Commercially produced Tilsiter is made from pasteurized cow 's milk , ranges from 30 to 60 % milk fat , and has a dark yellow rind . After the main part of its production , the cheese needs to rest for an additional 2 months . Often flavoured with caraway seed and peppercorns , Tilsiter is a complement to hearty brown/rye breads and dark beers . It is a common table cheese , yet versatile . Tilsit can be eaten cubed in salads , melted in sauces , on potatoes , in flans , or on burgers . \n \n Using the reimported recipe , Tilsiter has been manufactured in Switzerland since 1893 . Swiss Tilsiter is mainly produced in three varieties . A mild version ( green label ) is made from pasteurised milk , a more strongly flavoured one from fresh , unpasteurized milk ( red label ) , and the yellow-labeled `` Rahm-Tilsiter '' is produced from pasteurized milk with added cream . \n \n After World War II , when Tilsit and the rest of northern East Prussia became the Soviet Kaliningrad Oblast district , Tilsiter-style cheeses were produced in Switzerland and Germany .",

          "context": "Sbrinz is a very hard cheese produced in central Switzerland . It is often used instead of Parmesan cheese in Swiss cuisine . \n The cheese is produced in only 42 dairies in central Switzerland . Only local cow 's milk is used when producing this cheese . It is kept in the region until ready for consumption . \n Contrary to popular belief , the name Sbrinz does not originally refer to a particular place or region . Nevertheless , the Swiss Cheese Union added to this myth by launching an advertising campaign in the 1990s . As a result of this campaign , there is now an area called Sbrinz . \n \n Character \n \n Sbrinz is an extra hard full fat cheese . It contains approximately 40 % to 45 % of fat when dry . The cheese must ripen for 16 months before it can be sold as Sbrinz , and the full flavour only develops after about 24–30 months in storage . \n \n History \n \n Sbrinz is claimed to be the oldest European cheese . The Celtic ancestors of the Swiss were making cheese centuries before the recorded birth of Christ ; this cheese may have been an ancestor to modern Sbrinz . The official web site claims that the cheese was first mentioned in 70 AD , but does not give any details . Other sources claim that the cheese is mentioned in contracts dated around 1200 . It seems certain , however , that it is mentioned in documents dating from 1530 , which are kept in the state archive in Bern . \n \n Since 2001 , Sbrinz is an appellation d'origine contrôlée ( AOC ) . The AOC provides specifications for the origin of the milk and the processes that must be followed in order for the cheese to labeled as Sbrinz . In 2013 , it was replaced by the appellation d'origine protégée ( AOP ) certification . \n \n Consumption \n \n Sbrinz is commonly consumed in several ways ; it can be used grated , such as on pasta . It can be eaten in small pieces , often to accompany wine . It is also eaten in thin slices planed from the hard cheese . Sbrinz is often simply enjoyed with bread and butter .",

          "context": "Crème anglaise ( French for `` English cream '' ) is a light pouring custard used as a dessert cream or sauce . It is a mix of sugar , egg yolks and hot milk , often flavoured with vanilla . It is thought to have origins evolving from ancient Romans who used eggs as thickeners to create custards and creams . Its name may derive from the prevalence of sweet custards in English desserts . \n \n The cream is made by whipping egg yolks and sugar together until the yolk is almost white , and then slowly adding hot milk , while whisking . This process is commonly referred to as tempering . Vanilla beans ( seeds ) may be added for extra flavour and visual appeal . The sauce is then cooked over low heat ( excessive heating may cause the yolks to cook , resulting in scrambled eggs ) and stirred constantly with a spoon until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon , and then removed from the heat . It is also possible to set the sauce into custard cups and bake in a bain-marie until the egg yolks set . If the sauce reaches too high a temperature , it will curdle , although it can be salvaged by straining into a container placed in an ice bath . Cooking temperature should be between 70 °C ( 156 °F ) and 85 °C ( 185 °F ) ; the higher the temperature , the thicker the resulting cream , as long as the yolks are fully incorporated into the mixture . \n \n This can be poured as a sauce over cakes or fruits . Alternatively , it can be eaten as a dessert on its own , for example in Île flottante ( `` floating island '' ) : the cream is poured into a bowl with a piece of meringue ( blancs en neige ) floated on top along with praline . It can also be used as a base for desserts such as ice cream or crème brûlée . It has a mild taste but a rich , and thick vanilla flavour . However , the ice cream base is much thicker and has various flavourings . The American Amish call the sauce English pouring sauce . In the American South it is known as `` boiled custard '' , and it can be served like eggnog during the Christmas season . \n \n Other names include the French terms crème à l'anglaise ( `` English-style cream '' ) and crème française ( `` French cream '' ) .",

          "context": "Fear of being buried alive is the fear of being placed in a grave while still alive as a result of being incorrectly pronounced dead . The abnormal , psychopathological version of this fear is referred to as taphophobia ( from Greek τάφος - taphos , `` grave , tomb '' and φόβος - phobos , `` fear '' ) , which is translated as `` fear of graves '' . \n \n Before the advent of modern medicine , the fear was not entirely irrational . Throughout history , there have been numerous cases of people being buried alive by accident . In 1905 , the English reformer William Tebb collected accounts of premature burial . He found 219 cases of near live burial , 149 actual live burials , 10 cases of live dissection and 2 cases of awakening while being embalmed . \n \n The 18th century had seen the development of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and crude defibrillation techniques to revive persons considered dead , and the Royal Humane Society had been formed as the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned . In 1896 , an American funeral director , T.M . Montgomery , reported that `` nearly 2 % of those exhumed were no doubt victims of suspended animation , '' although folklorist Paul Barber has argued that the incidence of burial alive has been overestimated , and that the normal effects of decomposition are mistaken for signs of life . \n \n There have been many urban legends of people being accidentally buried alive . Legends included elements such as someone entering into the state of sopor or coma , only to wake up years later and die a horrible death . Other legends tell of coffins opened to find a corpse with a long beard or corpses with the hands raised and palms turned upward . Of note is a legend about the premature burial of Ann Hill Carter Lee , the wife of Henry Lee III . On his deathbed in 1799 , George Washington made his attendants promise not to bury him for two days . \n \n Literature found fertile ground in exploring the natural fear of being buried alive . One of Edgar Allan Poe 's horror stories , `` The Premature Burial '' , is about a person suffering from taphophobia . Other Poe stories about premature burial are `` The Fall of the House of Usher '' and `` The Cask of Amontillado '' —and to a lesser extent , “ The Black Cat ” . \n \n Fear of being buried alive was elaborated to the extent that those who could afford it would make all sorts of arrangements for the construction of a safety coffin to ensure this would be avoided ( e.g. , glass lids for observation , ropes to bells for signaling , and breathing pipes for survival until rescued ) . \n \n An urban legend states that the sayings `` Saved by the bell '' and `` Dead ringer '' are both derived from the notion of having a rope attached to a bell outside the coffin that could alert people that the recently buried person is not yet deceased ; these theories have been proven a hoax .",

Sutphin during the height of the Great Depression in 1937 as a playing site for Sutphin 's AHL team , the Cleveland Barons . The arena was at 3717 Euclid Avenue , and seated 9,900 in the stands and 12,500+ for events such as boxing where floor seating was available . \n \n In addition to the Barons , the arena was home to the Cleveland Rebels of the Basketball Association of America , also owned by Sutphin , for the 1946–47 season , and hosted several games for the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , who played more than 35 of their home games there from 1966-1970 . The arena and the Barons were purchased by Nick Mileti in 1968 . In 1970 , the expansion Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA moved into the arena and played there for their first four seasons , from 1970–1974 . The Cleveland Crusaders of the new World Hockey Association began play in 1972 , hosting games there until 1974 . \n \n Cleveland Arena was also a regular concert and boxing venue . On March 21 , 1952 it was the site of the Moondog Coronation Ball , considered the first rock and roll concert , organized by Alan Freed . The concert was shut down after the first song by fire authorities due to overcrowding . It was estimated 20,000 people were in the arena or trying to enter it , when the capacity was roughly half that . \n \n While the arena was a showpiece when it opened , by the time it closed in 1974 it had become decrepit and lacked adequate parking . It was replaced for sports and entertainment use by the Richfield Coliseum that year and demolished in 1977 . The headquarters of the Cleveland Chapter of the American Red Cross now occupies the site .",

In 2008 , part of this cemetery was being excavated from under the Town Hall . \n \n The station opened on 28 February 1932 . It was built with six platforms , which were split over two levels with three platforms on each level . When the station opened , only four of the platforms were in use : platforms 1 , 2 and 3 on the upper level and platform 6 , served by escalators , on the lower level . The other two platforms were built in preparation for a proposed western suburbs line from the city to Gladesville , as envisaged under the Bradfield scheme . This line was never built , and the platforms ( 4 and 5 ) remained disused until incorporated into the Eastern Suburbs line when it opened in June 1979 . \n \n The station concourse had a major restructure in 2005 when the shops inside were closed to make way for the increasing crowds . \n \n During a refurbishment of the station in 2014 , a sign pointing to an air-raid shelter was uncovered on a staircase leading to Platforms 1 and 2 . It has been encased in a persplex casing . \n \n Station configuration \n \n Town Hall has two levels , each with three platforms - physically two island platforms , but set up so that one faces two tracks and the other faces the other track . The station has lifts connecting the concourse with the platforms , providing Easy Access for wheelchairs .

Nowadays it is also made of pork or beef depending on local preferences and religious observances . The skewers are either threaded with meat only , or with alternating pieces of meat , fat , and vegetables , such as bell pepper , onion , mushroom and tomato . \n \n Usage \n \n The word `` shish '' ( , ) means skewer . The word `` shishlik '' is literally translated as `` skewerable '' . Even though the word `` shashlyk '' was borrowed from the Crimean Tatars by the Cossacks as early as the 16th century , kebabs did not reach Moscow until the late 19th century . From then on , their popularity spread rapidly ; by the 1910s they were a staple in St Petersburg restaurants and by the 1920s they were already a pervasive street food all over urban Russia . \n \n While it is not unusual to see shashlik today listed on the menu of restaurants , it is more commonly sold in the form of fast-food by street vendors who roast the skewers over wood , charcoal , or coal . It is also cooked in outdoor environments during social gatherings , similarly to barbecue in English-speaking countries . \n \n Preparation \n \n In Iranian cuisine , meat for shashlik ( as opposed to other forms of shish kebab ) is usually in form of large chunks of meat , while elsewhere the form of medium-size meat cubes is maintained making it similar to brochette . The meat is marinated overnight in a high-acidity marinade like vinegar , dry wine or sour fruit/vegetable juice with the addition of onions , herbs and spices . Shashlik is usually cooked on a grill called a mangal . \n \n Similar dishes \n \n * Anticuchos - Peru and other Andean states \n * Arrosticini - Italy ( Abruzzo ) \n * Brochette - France , Spain ( Catalonia ) \n * Chuanr - China \n * Churrasco — Brazil \n * Espetada - Portugal \n * Frigărui - Romania \n * Khorovats - Armenia \n * Mtsvadi - Georgia \n * Pinchitos - Spain ( Andalusia and Extremadura ) \n * Satay - Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , Brunei , Thailand , and the Netherlands \n * Souvlaki - Greece \n * Yakitori - Japan \n * Şiş kebap - Turkey \n * Sosatie - South Africa \n * Ražnjići - Serbia \n * Seekh Kebab - Bangladesh , Pakistan , Afghanistan and Northern India \n * Souvla - Cyprus",

Since the early 20th century this distinction has been lost in common usage even in Oxford , and some historians suggest the name Isis is nothing more than part of Tamesis , the Latin name for the Thames . \n \n Rowing \n \n The name Isis is especially used in the context of rowing at the University of Oxford . A number of rowing regattas are held on the Isis , including Eights Week , the most important Oxford University regatta , in the Trinity term ( summer ) , Torpids in the Hilary term ( early spring ) and Christ Church Regatta for novices in the Michaelmas term ( autumn ) . Because the width of the river is restricted at Oxford , rowing eights normally have a staggered start near Donnington Bridge and must then aim to `` bump '' the eight in front ( i.e . catch up and touch or overlap with it sufficiently ) . The leading eight aims to `` row over '' ( i.e . finish the race without being bumped ) . \n \n There used to be ornate wooden barges on the river bank here at the southern end of Christ Church Meadow to house rowing facilities and for viewing races . Now the barges are gone and there are boathouses instead a little further down the river near the confluence with the River Cherwell . Poplar Walk in Christ Church Meadow is used as a route to and from the boathouses . \n \n The name `` Isis '' is also used for the mens ' second rowing crew of Oxford University Boat Club , who race against the mens ' second crew of the Cambridge University Boat Club , Goldie , before the annual Boat Race on the Thames in London . \n \n Angling \n \n The Isis , like much of the Thames , has long been popular among anglers for its freshwater fish , including trout and crayfish . The Oxford region is home to several angling clubs . W. F. Wallett , a popular Victorian clown , shares in his memoirs his own humorous anecdote about fishing in the Isis with the celebrated circus proprietor Pablo Fanque : \n \n Related uses \n \n Sculptures of Isis and Tamesis by Anne Seymour Damer can be found on Henley Bridge downstream at Henley-on-Thames , Oxfordshire . \n \n Each of the Formula Student cars manufactured by the Oxford Brookes Racing team uses the name ISIS in the beginning of its chassis number . ISIS is then succeeded by the year number ; for example , ISIS XII was the 2012 chassis , nicknamed `` Miss Piggy '' .",

The pair of pips resembles a pair of eyes , which is appended to the term 'snake ' because of the long-standing association of this word with treachery and betrayal . The dictionary of etymology traces that use of the term back to 1929 , although it may be traced all the way back to the ancient Roman dice games , where 'Dogs ' represented two ones . They referred to this as `` the dog throw '' . In modern parlance , it refers to such a roll in any game involving dice . \n \n Because this is the lowest possible roll , and will often be a loser in many dice games , such as Craps , the term has been employed in a more general usage as a reference to bad luck . In some board games , such as Monopoly , house rules may decide that this roll earns the player a bonus due to it being rare and otherwise disadvantageous . \n \n Probability \n \n The odds of rolling snake eyes on two six-sided dice are 1-in-36 .",

Males are usually larger than females . \n \n The plumage is typically chestnut , dark brown or black , although the Green oropendola and olive oropendola have , as their names imply , an olive coloration to the head , breast and upper back . The legs are dark , but the bill is usually a strikingly contrasting feature , either pale yellow , or red-tipped with a green or black base . In several species there is also a blue or pink bare cheek patch . \n \n Oropendolas are birds associated with forests or , for a few species , more open woodland . They are colonial breeders , with several long woven basket nests in a tree , each hanging from the end of a branch . \n \n These gregarious birds eat large insects and fruit . They are very vocal , producing a wide range of songs and calls , sometimes including mimicry . \n \n Systematics \n \n Six of the species in the genus Psarocolius indeed belong there : \n * Black oropendola , Psarocolius guatimozinus \n * Chestnut-headed oropendola , Psarocolius wagleri \n * Russet-backed oropendola , Psarocolius angustifrons \n * Dusky-green oropendola , Psarocolius atrovirens \n * Green oropendola , Psarocolius viridis \n * Crested oropendola , Psarocolius decumanus \n \n Four somewhat different species were formerly separated in the genus Gymnostinops . Alternatively , the crested oropendola ( and possibly others ) would also belong here ( Price & Lanyon 2002 ) : \n * Montezuma oropendola , Psarocolius montezuma \n * Baudo oropendola , Psarocolius cassini \n * Olive oropendola , Psarocolius bifasciatus \n \n Price & Lanyon ( 2002 ) used mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data to research oropendola phylogeny . As is fairly obvious from morphology , the band-tailed oropendola , Ocyalus latirostris and casqued oropendola , Psarocolius oseryi are the most distinct oropendola species . In fact , they appear to be more closely related to the caciques and both species would go into Ocyalus . Alternatively , the casqued oropendola may be separated in Clypicterus , which like Ocyalus would then be a monotypic genus .",

It is not a true cobra in that it does not belong to the genus Naja , but instead belongs to the monotypic genus Hemachatus . It is closely related to the true cobras . \n \n Description \n \n Coloration varies throughout its distribution area , but a characteristic of the species is the belly is dark with one or two light-coloured crossbands on the throat . Their average length is 90–110 cm . Some individuals may have a mostly black body , while others are striped . Rinkhals scales are distinct from those of true cobras in that they are ridged and keel-like . \n \n Scale pattern and distribution \n \n Scalation : \n * dorsal scales are keeled \n * 17–19 rows of dorsal scales at midbody \n * 116–150 ventral scales \n * anal plate is entire \n * 30–47 subcaudal scales , paired \n * 7 upper labial scales \n * upper labials 3 and 4 entering the eye \n * 1 preocular ( rarely up to 3 ) \n * 3 postoculars \n * 8–9 lower labials \n \n Distribution \n \n This species is found in the Southern Cape province of South Africa , northeast through the Free State , Lesotho , Transkei , Kwazulu Natal , South Africa , Western Swaziland , Mpumalanga and parts of Gauteng , South Africa . An isolated population is centered on Inyanga on the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border . \n \n Behaviour and diet \n \n The rinkhals has a varied diet . Its main prey is toads , but it also eats small mammals , amphibians , and other reptiles . \n \n Rinkhals are unique amongst African cobras in being ovoviviparous . They give birth to 20–35 young , but as many as 65 young have been recorded . \n \n Venom \n \n The venom of the rinkhals is neurotoxic and partially cytotoxic , and is less viscous than that of other African elapids . When confronting a human , it generally aims its venom at the face . If the venom enters the eyes , it causes great pain . \n \n Symptoms of a bite \n \n Local symptoms of swelling and bruising is reported in about 25 % ( a quarter ) of cases . General symptoms of drowsiness , nausea , vomiting , violent abdominal pain , cramps and vertigo often occur , as does a mild pyrexial reaction . \n \n Defensive behaviour \n \n If distressed , the rinkhals spreads its hood , showing its distinctive , striped neck . It is a spitting snake , and can spray its venom up to 2.5 m. Its spitting mechanism is primitive and it has to rear up and fling its body forward to spray its venom . It is also known to fake death by rolling onto its back with its mouth agape . \n \n Habitat \n \n The rinkhals generally prefers grassland habitats because it allows them to blend in with the surroundings . Rinkhals also may live in swamps around southern Africa .",

Common names include water clover and four-leaf clover because the long-stalked leaves have four clover-like lobes and are either held above water or submerged . \n \n The sporocarps of some Australian species are very drought-resistant , surviving up to 100 years in dry conditions . On wetting , the gelatinous interior of the sporocarp swells , splitting it and releasing a worm-like mass that carries sori , eventually leading to germination of spores and fertilization . \n \n Uses \n \n As food \n \n Sporocarps of some Australian species such as Marsilea drummondii are edible and have been eaten by Aborigines and early white settlers , who knew it under the name ngardu or nardoo . Parts of Marsilea drummondii contain an enzyme which destroys thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) , leading to brain damage in sheep and horses . During floods in the Gwydir River basin 2,200 sheep died after eating nardoo . Three-quarters of the sheep that were affected did however respond to thiamine injections . Thiamine deficiency from incorrectly prepared nardoo likely resulted in the starvation and death of Burke and Wills . \n \n The leaves of Marsilea crenata are part of the East Javanese cuisine of Indonesia , especially in the city of Surabaya .

The abnormal , psychopathological version of this fear is referred to as taphophobia ( from Greek τάφος - taphos , `` grave , tomb '' and φόβος - phobos , `` fear '' ) , which is translated as `` fear of graves '' . \n \n Before the advent of modern medicine , the fear was not entirely irrational . Throughout history , there have been numerous cases of people being buried alive by accident . In 1905 , the English reformer William Tebb collected accounts of premature burial . He found 219 cases of near live burial , 149 actual live burials , 10 cases of live dissection and 2 cases of awakening while being embalmed . \n \n The 18th century had seen the development of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and crude defibrillation techniques to revive persons considered dead , and the Royal Humane Society had been formed as the Society for the Recovery of Persons Apparently Drowned . In 1896 , an American funeral director , T.M . Montgomery , reported that `` nearly 2 % of those exhumed were no doubt victims of suspended animation , '' although folklorist Paul Barber has argued that the incidence of burial alive has been overestimated , and that the normal effects of decomposition are mistaken for signs of life . \n \n There have been many urban legends of people being accidentally buried alive . Legends included elements such as someone entering into the state of sopor or coma , only to wake up years later and die a horrible death . Other legends tell of coffins opened to find a corpse with a long beard or corpses with the hands raised and palms turned upward . Of note is a legend about the premature burial of Ann Hill Carter Lee , the wife of Henry Lee III . On his deathbed in 1799 , George Washington made his attendants promise not to bury him for two days . \n \n Literature found fertile ground in exploring the natural fear of being buried alive . One of Edgar Allan Poe 's horror stories , `` The Premature Burial '' , is about a person suffering from taphophobia . Other Poe stories about premature burial are `` The Fall of the House of Usher '' and `` The Cask of Amontillado '' —and to a lesser extent , “ The Black Cat ” . \n \n Fear of being buried alive was elaborated to the extent that those who could afford it would make all sorts of arrangements for the construction of a safety coffin to ensure this would be avoided ( e.g. , glass lids for observation , ropes to bells for signaling , and breathing pipes for survival until rescued ) . \n \n An urban legend states that the sayings `` Saved by the bell '' and `` Dead ringer '' are both derived from the notion of having a rope attached to a bell outside the coffin that could alert people that the recently buried person is not yet deceased ; these theories have been proven a hoax .",

It is approximately the energy equivalent of burning 100 cubic feet ( often referred to as 1 CCF ) of natural gas . \n \n Since natural gas meters measure volume and not energy content , a therm factor is used by ( Natural ) gas companies to convert the volume of gas used to its heat equivalent , and thus calculate the actual energy use . The therm factor is usually in the units therms/CCF . It will vary with the mix of hydrocarbons in the natural gas . Natural gas with a higher than average concentration of ethane , propane or butane will have a higher therm factor . Impurities , such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen , lower the therm factor . \n \n The volume of the gas is calculated as if measured at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ) . The heat content of natural gas is solely dependent on the composition of the gas , and is independent of temperature and pressure . \n \n One therm is equal to about 105.5 megajoules , 25,200 kilocalories or 29.3 kilowatt-hours . One therm can also be provided by about of natural gas . The therm sometimes has been confused with the thermie ( see below ) . The names of both units come from the Greek word for heat . \n \n A thermie ( th ) is a metric unit of heat energy , part of the meter-tonne-second system sometimes used by European engineers . The thermie is equal to the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 tonne of water by 1 °C .

Despite this , natural gas is now usually retailed in kilowatt-hours , although the wholesale UK gas market trades in therms , with a typical forward transaction being for 25,000 therms ( 31 MW ) per day . In the United States natural gas is commonly billed in CCFs ( hundreds of cubic feet ) or therms . \n \n Carbon footprint \n \n According to the EPA burning one therm of natural gas produces on average 11.7 lbs or 5.3 kilogram of carbon dioxide , see http : //www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html # results .",

Following victory in the national under-19′s Championship , Foulds then turned professional in 1983 and at the end of the season qualified for final stages of the World Championship at the first attempt . Even more impressively however , he then defeated twice-champion Alex Higgins 10-9 in the first round before going down 13-9 to Doug Mountjoy in the last 16 , a run that saw him enter the rankings at number 30 . \n \n Foulds quickly climbed the rankings in the seasons that followed reaching no . 3 within four years . He won his first ranking tournament in 1986 , the BCE International , beating Cliff Thorburn 12–9 in the final . In the same season he was runner-up to Steve Davis in the UK Championship , and he also reached the semi-finals of the 1987 World Championship , losing 16–9 to Joe Johnson . \n Starting the following season up in a career high position of number three , 1987/88 was not to be quite as successful , though another strong run to the quarter-finals in the 1988 World Snooker Championship before losing to Terry Griffiths ensured that he would retain his spot at third in the rankings \n \n From here however he started to struggle , dropping 17 places to 20th in the rankings and finding himself having to qualify for events in the following season . Still , 1989/90 was to see a revival and despite a round one exit at the World Championship to Wayne Jones , he did enough to regain a place in the top 16 before moving up to number seven at the end of 1990/1 . \n \n Though he was able to maintain a top 16 place until the end of the 1993/4 season , and a place on the tour until 2004 , from the mid-90′s Foulds struggled for form and eventually retired from the sport in 2004 . \n \n Foulds made 76 competitive century breaks in his career . \n \n Commentary career \n \n Since his retirement , Foulds has moved up to the commentary box for the BBC , Eurosport , Sky Sports and he also co-hosts all ITV4 tournament coverage , interviewing players as well as commentating . Foulds also works for Ladbrokes , providing in-shop commentary on racing . In 2014 , Foulds made a cameo as himself commentating on a fictional match at the climax of the snooker short film drama 'Extended Rest ' .

He produced his best performance in 1974 , when he reached the quarter-final , subsequently losing his match against Miles 13–15 .

The tournament , played on a three-man-group round-robin basis , saw Dunning start as a 7–1 outsider to qualify from his first group . After he beat Tony Knowles 2–1 in the opening game , he became favourite , before comfortably winning his next match against Les Dodd . In his semi-final match , he played against Australian Warren King and Terry Griffiths of Wales . Dunning lost to King , but beat Griffiths , which made his place in the final , in which he met Dave Martin and the reigning World Champion and world number one Steve Davis .

Hendrikje 's interest in discovering the history of this first bag triggered a passion for collecting handbags . Before too long she had collected more than 3,000 bags . She soon decided to show part of the collection to the public . At first , the museum existed in two rooms of a villa in Amstelveen , but as the collection grew , the couple looked for a new location . Since June 2007 , the museum is located in a 17th Century patrician house at the Herengracht , Amsterdam 's most prestigious canal . \n \n Today , the Museum of Bags and Purses is a serious institution with a permanent exhibition presenting the core of the collection and temporary shows of the particular designers , mostly Dutch . \n \n Collection \n \n The earliest handbags in the museum 's collection are typically small , used to carry coins , keys and sewing kits . Such bags were carried , by both men and women , under clothing to avoid drawing the attention of thieves . The development of pants with pockets for men , and the change from billowing skirts to more form-fitting dresses , led to handbags becoming an item for women , often with elaborate adornment . \n \n With the coming of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century , technology and the growth of rail travel accessible to the middle class led to larger handbags , often made of durable leather . \n \n Brand name bags came to the fore in the 1950s , epitomized by items in the collection including a quilted Chanel purse and the Hermès Kelly bag .",

The main characters were Dr. Finlay , a junior partner in the practice , played by Bill Simpson , Dr. Cameron , the craggy senior partner , played by Andrew Cruickshank , and Janet , their unflappable housekeeper and receptionist at Arden House , played by Barbara Mullen . Dr. Finlay returned to television with the ITV series , Doctor Finlay , continuing the stories into the late 1940s , which featured David Rintoul as Dr. Finlay , Ian Bannen as Dr. Cameron , and Annette Crosbie as Janet . It later aired in the U.S. on PBS ' Masterpiece Theatre . \n \n Character \n \n In the books , Dr Finlay worked alone . He was charming and became well-acquainted with his patients over many years .

The purported background of some such associated feelings may be due to an egalitarian-related sentiment , whereby one feels a sense of solidarity with individuals in the lowest Human Development Index countries . For others , a recurring thought that some things are too good to be true has resulted in an ingrainedness that they are not entitled to feel too good . The condition is relatively rare . Sometimes , it can be triggered by a religious upbringing wherein asceticism is propounded .",

The name Artiodactyla comes from the Greek ἄρτιος ( ártios ) , `` even '' , and δάκτυλος ( dáktylos ) , `` finger/toe '' ; so the name `` even-toed '' is a translation of the order name . The aquatic Cetaceans evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors , and modern taxonomic classification therefore subsumes Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetiartiodactyla . \n \n The roughly 220 artiodactyl species include pigs , peccaries , hippopotamuses , whales , camels , llamas , alpacas , mouse deer , deer , giraffes , antelopes , sheep , goats , and cattle , many of which are of great dietary , economic , and cultural importance to humans . \n \n Taxonomy and phylogeny \n \n The classification of artiodactyls was hotly debated because the ocean-dwelling cetaceans evolved from land-dwelling even-toed ungulates , yet some semi-aquatic land-dwelling even-toed ungulates ( hippopotamuses ) are more closely related to the ocean-dwelling cetaceans than to the other land-dwelling even-toed ungulates . \n \n This makes the traditional artiodactyls a paraphyletic taxon , since they descend from a common ancestor , but do not include all its descendants . Phylogenetic classification only recognizes monophyletic taxa , that is , groups that descend from a common ancestor and include all its descendants .

It is a sheep farm and has been a national nature reserve since 1955 . \n \n Geography \n \n Noss is separated from the island of Bressay by the narrow Noss Sound . It has been run as a sheep farm since 1900 . \n \n Noss had a population of 20 in 1851 but has had no permanent inhabitants since 1939 . The main focus of settlement on Noss was around the low lying west side of the island at Gungstie ( Old Norse : a landing place ) . Gungstie was built in the 1670s and is currently used by the seasonal wildlife wardens . Another settlement at Setter , on the south east of the island was inhabited until the 1870s and now lies derelict . Among the few families living on Noss were the Booth family headed by Joseph Booth ( 1765–1847 ) . Genealogical records indicate that he was occupied as a farmer and fish curer . Records show that he was resident on Noss as early as 1834 . \n \n Wildlife \n \n Noss has been a national nature reserve since 1955 . The island is linked to Bressay by a seasonal ferry service , run by the wildlife wardens using an inflatable boat . \n \n Attractions on Noss include a visitor centre , the Pony Pund built to breed Shetland ponies , the Holm of Noss rock and the Noup cliff . The sandstone cliffs of Noss have weathered into a series of horizontal ledges making ideal breeding grounds for gannets , puffins , guillemots , shags , black-legged kittiwakes , razorbills , fulmars and great skuas . Otters are frequently seen around the island . \n \n Gallery \n \n File : Noss Noup of Noss Noss Head.jpg|Noup of Noss and Noss Head \n File : Noss Pundsgeo.jpg|Pundsgeo \n File : Noss Holm of Noss.jpg \n File : Noss North Croo Building.jpg",

Populations migrating between fresh and salt water ( anadromous ) have been extirpated . \n \n Due to overfishing ( for its flesh , caviar , and isinglass ) , pollution , and dams , the sterlet has declined throughout its native range and is considered vulnerable by the IUCN .

According to the church history , each member of the church who was 12 or older was asked to give $ 45 a year and six wagonloads of stone to help construct the building . The nickname The Cathedral of the Plains was bestowed by former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan after he visited the town in 1912 . Its 48 historic stained-glass windows were installed in 1916 , by Munich Studios in Chicago , at a cost of $ 3,700 , and now valued at more than $ 1 million . The church was added to the National Register in 1971 . \n \n In 1994 , the church began a series of restoration efforts . More than $ 265,000 was spent on weatherproofing the exterior , replastering and repainting the interior and updating the sound , electrical and heating systems . A marble floor was put in the sanctuary for $ 60,000 , replacing the old carpeting and linoleum floors . The church roof was reshingled in 2006 for $ 137,000 . In 2011 , the church replaced the parking lot and sidewalks for $ 225,000 , and spent $ 70,000 on repairing the plaster ceilings and walls that had cracked with age . A plastic covering was installed in the mid-1980s to protect each stained glass window from Kansas storms . It had grown opaque through the years and replaced with tempered glass in 2013 . \n \n After approval by the Vatican in early March 2014 , Bishop Edward Weisenburger of the Diocese of Salina dedicated St. Fidelis Church as a Minor Basilica on Saturday , June 7 , 2014 . \n \n Gallery \n \n Image : Cathdral of the plains victoria ks.jpg|Interior of St. Fidelis Catholic Church in 2011 \n Image : Marker.jpg|Plaque near the church in 1997",

Their most famous track was `` The Tide Is High '' , written by band member John Holt . \n \n Career \n \n The Paragons were originally Garth `` Tyrone '' Evans , songwriter Bob Andy , Junior Menz , and Leroy Stamp . In 1964 Stamp was replaced by singer and songwriter John Holt , and Howard Barrett replaced Menz . \n \n The early Paragons sound used the vocal harmonies of Jamaican groups of the early 1960s . Beginning in 1964 , they recorded on the Treasure Isle record label with record producer Duke Reid , songs such as `` Memories by the Score '' , `` On the Beach '' , `` Only a Smile '' and `` Wear You to the Ball '' , which were later covered by UB40 , Horace Andy , Dennis Brown , Massive Attack , and others . Other recordings included `` Man Next Door '' aka `` Quiet Place '' / '' I 've Got to Get Away '' ( 1968 ) and `` Happy Go Lucky Girl '' . \n \n The Paragons ' recordings , including the widely covered `` The Tide Is High '' from 1967 , written by Holt , and featuring the violin of `` White Rum '' Raymond , are among the highlights of Jamaican popular music . `` The Tide Is High '' was taken to the top of the UK and US charts by Blondie in 1980 ; while Atomic Kitten 's cover version also topped the UK Singles Chart in 2002 . \n \n The group reformed in the late 1970s and released further albums in the late 1970s and early 1980s . \n \n Evans died in 2000 , and Holt in October 2014 . \n \n Discography \n \n Studio albums \n \n * On The Beach ( 1967 ) \n * With Roslyn Sweat ( 1974 ) \n * The Paragons ( 1981 ) \n * Now ( 1981 ) \n * Positive Movements ( 1982 ) \n * Heaven & Earth ( 1996 ) \n * The Paragons Sing The Beatles And Bob Dylan ( 1998 ) \n * The Legendary Paragons ( 2000 ) \n * Yellowman Meets The Paragons ( 2002 ) \n * The Paragons Return \n \n ; Contributing artist \n * The Rough Guide to Reggae ( 1997 , World Music Network )",

The song is sung in the film by `` Uncle Albert '' ( Ed Wynn ) , and `` Bert '' ( Dick Van Dyke ) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling , eventually joined by Mary Poppins ( Julie Andrews ) herself . The premise of the scene , that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert ( and like-minded visitors ) to float into the air , can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can `` lighten '' a mood . ( Compare Peter Pan 's flight power , which is also powered by happy thoughts . ) Conversely , thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors `` down to earth '' again . The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter , even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert 's behavior , especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down , but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well . \n \n The scene is based on the chapter `` Laughing Gas '' in the book Mary Poppins by P.L . Travers . In the book , Mary 's Uncle Albert , also called Mr. Wigg , is said to float because of an excess of `` laughing gas '' , although it is clear that the term is not used in the chemical sense . So-called `` laughing gas '' ( nitrous oxide ) was one of the earliest effective anaesthetics developed in the Nineteenth century . it was popularised by dentists , for pain-free tooth extractions , as well as by showground novelty booths . Customers at the booth would be gassed and , as they were recovering from the drugged sleep they often felt euphoric and giggly . Hence the name . A famous 1931 British comedy sketch starring Cicely Courtneidge , called `` Laughing Gas '' , was based on this idea . A group of people meet , very seriously , to hear the reading of a will . However a large bottle of laughing gas has been placed just off-stage , and begins to leak . As the will is read , the listeners become increasingly hysterical , despite the obvious seriousness of the death-related situation , with obvious comic effects . \n \n This musical number also appears in the Sing Along Songs series of Disney videos . Neither this song or Uncle Albert are featured in the stage musical version . \n \n Literary sources \n \n * Sherman , Robert B. Walt 's Time : from before to beyond .

He was educated at Brighton Grammar School in England and Lewes . He travelled to California during the California Gold Rush , but his prospecting there was not successful . On 12 February 1851 he , with John Lister , found five specks of gold in Lewis Ponds Creek in New South Wales in Australia . Enlisting the help of others to continue the search , he returned to Sydney in March to interview the Colonial Secretary , and , encouraged by his friends at Bathurst , wrote to the Sydney Morning Herald describing the rich fields . \n \n Hargraves was rewarded by the New South Wales Government for his find – he was paid £10,000 and was appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands . The Victorian Government paid him £5,000 . He only claimed £2,381 before the funds were frozen after James Lister protested . An enquiry was held in 1853 which upheld that Hargraves was the first to discover the goldfield . The goldfield was then named Ophir . \n \n In 1856 , Hargraves purchased a 640 acre landing at Budgewoi on the Central Coast of New South Wales . He went on to build `` Norahville '' at Noraville . Wollombi Aboriginal Tribe members are known to have worked on the property . Some sources state that Hargraves had `` befriended '' the Aboriginal tribe members . \n \n In 1877 , Hargraves was granted a pension of £250 per year by the Government of New South Wales , which he received until his death . \n Shortly before his death in Sydney on 29 October 1891 , a second enquiry found that John Lister and James Tom had discovered the first goldfield . Lister is buried in the cemetery at Millthorpe , NSW and Tom at Byng , NSW , both within 20km of Ophir . \n \n Hargraves wrote a book about his discovery titled Australia and its Goldfields : a historical sketch of the Australian colonies from the earliest times to the present day with a particular account of the recent gold discoveries , published in 1855 .",

Galliano uses vanillin for flavouring and sugar and glucose syrup for sweetening . Caramel and tartrazine are used to achieve Galliano 's bright yellow colour . Neutral alcohol is infused with the pressings from the herbs except for the vanilla . The liquid is distilled and then infused with separately pressed vanilla . In the final stage , distilled water , refined sugar and pure neutral alcohol are blended with the base . Galliano has been formulated at both 60 proof ( 30 % by volume ) and 84.6 proof ( 42.3 % by volume ) . \n \n Taste \n \n Galliano is sweet with vanilla-anise flavour and subtle citrus and woodsy herbal undernotes . The vanilla top note differentiates Galliano from other anise-flavoured liqueurs such as Sambuca , Pernod , or Anisette . It is used both as a digestivo ( meant for drinking after heavy meals ) , and as an ingredient for cocktails , most notably the Harvey Wallbanger , Golden Cadillac , and Golden Dream . It is also used in a popular Brooklyn cocktail , Mr. October , which the New York Times notes , `` tastes like apple pie à la mode , thanks to Galliano ’ s vanilla notes . '' \n \n Ownership \n \n The Galliano brand is currently owned by Dutch distiller Lucas Bols , and marketed through its worldwide distribution joint venture , Maxxium . Galliano is packaged in a distinctively shaped bottle , reminiscent of a classical Roman column . \n Several other liqueurs are also produced under the Galliano brand name , including a black Sambuca , a white Sambuca and an amaretto , which are predominantly distributed in Australasia , where the products are popular as shots . \n Galliano also makes Galliano Ristretto coffee-flavored liqueur and Galliano Balsamico , a balsamic vinegar-infused liqueur . Both Galliano Autentico and Galliano Vanilla , as used in the Harvey Wallbanger , are available . \n \n Awards \n \n Galliano has earned bronze and silver medals from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition . Another spirit ratings organization , Wine Enthusiast , gave Galliano L'autentico a score of `` 90-95 '' in 2011 . \n \n Notes",

          "context": "Acmeism , or the Guild of Poets , was a transient poetic school , which emerged in 1910 in Russia under the leadership of Nikolay Gumilev and Sergei Gorodetsky . Their ideals were compactness of form and clarity of expression . The term was coined after the Greek word akme , i.e. , `` the best age of man '' . \n \n The acmeist mood was first announced by Mikhail Kuzmin in his 1910 essay `` Concerning Beautiful Clarity '' . The acmeists contrasted the ideal of Apollonian clarity ( hence the name of their journal , Apollon ) to `` Dionysian frenzy '' propagated by the Russian symbolist poets like Bely and Vyacheslav Ivanov . To the Symbolists ' preoccupation with `` intimations through symbols '' they preferred `` direct expression through images '' . \n \n In his later manifesto `` The Morning of Acmeism '' ( 1913 ) , Osip Mandelstam defined the movement as `` a yearning for world culture '' . As a `` neo-classical form of modernism '' , which essentialized `` poetic craft and cultural continuity '' , the Guild of Poets placed Alexander Pope , Théophile Gautier , Rudyard Kipling , Innokentiy Annensky , and the Parnassian poets among their predecessors . \n \n Major poets in this school include Osip Mandelstam , Nikolay Gumilev , Mikhail Kuzmin , Anna Akhmatova , and Georgiy Ivanov . The group originally met in The Stray Dog Cafe , St. Petersburg , then a celebrated meeting place for artists and writers . Mandelstam 's collection of poems Stone ( 1912 ) is considered the movement 's finest accomplishment . \n \n Amongst the major acmeist poets , each interpreted acmeism in a different stylistic light , from Akhmatova 's intimate poems on topics of love and relationships to Gumilev 's narrative verse .",

          "context": "`` The Whitsun Weddings '' , read here [ http : //www.poetryarchive.org/poem/whitsun-weddings ] by Larkin himself , is one of the best known poems by British poet Philip Larkin . It was written and rewritten and finally published in the 1967 collection of poems , also called The Whitsun Weddings . It is one of three poems that Larkin wrote about train journeys . \n \n The poem comprises eight stanzas of ten lines , making it one of his longest poems . The rhyming scheme is a , b , a , b , c , d , e , c , d , e , f - ( a rhyme scheme used in various of Keats ' odes ) . \n \n Larkin describes a stopping-train journey southwards from Paragon Station , Kingston upon Hull , where Larkin was a librarian at the university , on a hot Whitsun Saturday afternoon . It has always been supposed the poem was based on an actual train journey Larkin made in 1955 on Whitsun Saturday , a day which was popular for weddings at that time though since there was a rail strike on that weekend Larkin scholar John Osborne now thinks the journey an unlikely one to have taken place . Larkin 's letters mention two journeys , one to Grantham ( not at Whit , some weddings ) , and one to London ( not at Whit , no weddings ) , that may have been conflated in the poem . \n \n The poem 's narrator describes the scenery and smells of the countryside and towns through which the largely empty train passes . The train 's windows are open because of the heat , and he gradually becomes aware of bustle on the platforms at each station , eventually realising that this is the noise and actions of wedding parties that are seeing off couples who are boarding the train . \n \n He notes the different classes of people involved , each with their own responses to the occasion - the fathers , the uncles , the children , the unmarried female relatives . He imagines the venues where the wedding receptions have been held . \n \n As the train continues into London , with the afternoon shadows lengthening , his reflections turn to the permanence of what the newly-weds have done , yet its significance , though huge for them , seems to give him an ultimately disappointing message , suggested by the poem 's final phrase . However , as a counter balance , rain brings fertility . \n ... there swelled \n A sense of falling , like an arrow-shower \n Sent out of sight , somewhere becoming rain .",

Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824 . Lobbying by the radical tailor Francis Place played a role in this .

It entered into game production in 1922 , due to a boom in demand for playing cards around World War I. Waddingtons subsequently sold both original games ( especially tie-ins for UK television programmes ) and games licensed from other publishers . \n \n Waddingtons became the UK publisher of Parker Brothers ' Monopoly , while Parker licensed Waddingtons ' Cluedo . In 1941 , the British Secret Service had the company create a special edition of Monopoly for World War II prisoners of war held by the Germans . \n Hidden inside these games were maps , compasses , real money and other objects useful for escaping . They were distributed to prisoners by the International Red Cross . \n \n Victor Watson served as its chairman from 1977 to 1993 . The company was bought by Hasbro in 1994 . \n \n Beginning in 1994 , Christmas-themed jigsaw puzzles were released annually until 2007 , a total of thirteen puzzles . The first twelve in the series depicted a scene from a Victorian-era Christmas . The final puzzle depicted a scene from the fairy tale Cinderella . The small number of puzzles , combined with the fact that they were all limited editions , has made these puzzles among the most sought-after in the world . \n \n Games \n \n Among the games published by Waddingtons were : \n * 4000 AD \n * Air Charter \n * Astron \n * Battle of the Little Big Horn \n * Bewitched \n * Bigfoot \n * Black Box \n * Blast Off ! \n * Buccaneer \n * Campaign \n * Camelot \n * Careers \n * Cluedo ( 1949 ) \n * Do n't Miss The Boat \n * Escape from Atlantis \n * Equals \n * Exploration \n * Formula 1 \n * Game of Nations \n * Go ( not the Chinese game of Weiqi , but based on world travel ) \n * Golfwinks \n * Key to the Kingdom \n * Keyword \n * Kimbo \n * Lexicon \n * Lose Your Shirt \n * Lost Valley of the Dinosaurs \n * Milestones \n * Monopoly \n * Mine a Million ( rebranded as The Business Game ) \n * Purple People Eater \n * Railroader \n * Ratrace \n * Risk \n * Safari Round Up \n * Scoop ! \n * Sorry ! \n * Speculate ( Share Trading game ) \n * Spy Ring \n * Subbuteo \n * The Vampire Game \n * Totopoly \n * Ulcers \n * Whot ! \n \n In popular culture \n \n In Avid Merrion 's Bo ! in the USA during a conversation with Justin Timberlake , Avid claimed that `` He 'd get in touch with Waddingtons '' when Justin said that he 'd enjoyed Avid 's idea for a board game , Avid Meats Justin .",

          "context": "Caffè macchiato ( ) , sometimes called espresso macchiato , is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk , usually foamed . In Italian , macchiato means `` stained '' or `` spotted '' so the literal translation of caffè macchiato is `` stained coffee '' , or coffee with a spot of milk . \n \n History \n \n The origin of the name `` macchiato '' stems from baristas needing to show the serving waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a tiny bit of milk in it ; the latter was `` marked '' . The idea is reflected in the Portuguese name for the drink : café pingado , meaning coffee with a drop . \n \n Preparation \n \n See also : latte macchiato and caffè latte . \n The caffè macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients . The intent is that the milk moderates , rather than overwhelms , the taste of the coffee while adding a touch of sweetness . The drink is typically prepared by pouring a small amount of steamed milk directly into a single shot of espresso . One recipe calls for 1-2 teaspoons of milk heated to 140-150F ( 60-65C ) . \n \n Variations \n \n Numerous variations exist around the world . \n Examples include : \n * Caffè macchiato , where the coffee is equal parts steamed milk and coffee , where the coffee is poured after the milk , creating a mark in the foam ; \n * Short macchiato , where a short black has a small amount ( usually around 5–10mL ) of milk poured into it , marking the crema ; \n * Long macchiato , where a long black ( made either with 2 shots of espresso , or a single shot , lengthened with hot water ( cafe americano ) ) has a small amount ( usually around 20–30mL ) of milk poured into it , marking the crema . \n \n Australia \n \n In Australia the 'caffè macchiato ' and 'latte macchiato ' are essentially unknown . However , the short macchiato and ( especially ) the long macchiato are popular , particularly in Melbourne . However , they are not always prepared the same way . \n \n In Perth , one popular chain of coffee shops promotes two categories of macchiato ( all of which they refer to as `` macchiato autentico '' ) : \n * the traditional long or short macchiato , which is espresso-sized ; \n * the topped up long or short macchiato , which contains more hot water . \n In Melbourne , either of those two interpretations can be found in almost every coffee shop , but never both ( except upon special request ) . \n In Sydney the macchiato is a relatively uncommon type of coffee . \n \n Photos \n \n Image : Ethiopian caffè macchiato.jpg|Ethiopia is well known for its caffè macchiato .

( Oxford English Dictionary ) It is used to dye Buddhist monks ' robes because the color is a deep tone of saffron , the traditional color used for the robes of Theravada Buddhist monks . \n \n Production \n \n Gamboge is most often extracted by tapping resin ( sometimes incorrectly referred to as sap ) from various species of evergreen trees of the family Clusiaceae ( also known as Guttiferae ) . The tree most commonly used is the gamboge tree ( genus Garcinia ) , including G. hanburyi ( Cambodia and Thailand ) , G. morella ( India and Sri Lanka ) , and G. elliptica and G. heterandra ( Myanmar ) . The orange fruit of Garcinia gummi-gutta ( formerly called G. cambogia ) is also known as gamboge or gambooge . \n \n The trees must be at least ten years old before they are tapped . The resin is extracted by making spiral incisions in the bark , and by breaking off leaves and shoots and letting the milky yellow resinous gum drip out . The resulting latex is collected in hollow bamboo canes . After the resin is congealed , the bamboo is broken away and large rods of raw gamboge remain . \n \n Etymology \n \n The word gamboge comes from gambogium , the Latin word for the pigment , which derives from Gambogia , the Latin word for Cambodia . Its first recorded use as a color name in English was in 1634 . \n \n New gamboge \n \n `` New gamboge '' is synthetic yellow pigment . The pigment has a color similar to that of natural gamboge .",

          "context": "In color theory , a tint is the mixture of a color with white , which increases lightness , and a shade is the mixture of a color with black , which reduces lightness . A tone is produced either by the mixture of a color with gray , or by both tinting and shading . Mixing a color with any neutral color ( including black , gray and white ) reduces the chroma , or colorfulness , while the hue remains unchanged . \n \n In common language , the term `` shade '' can be generalized to furthermore encompass any varieties of a particular color , whether technically they are shades , tints , tones , or slightly different hues ; while the term `` tint '' can be generalized to refer to any lighter or darker variation of a color ( e.g . Tinted windows ) . \n \n When mixing colored light ( additive color models ) , the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red , green and blue ( RGB ) is always white , not gray or black . When we mix colorants , such as the pigments in paint mixtures , a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma , or saturation , than the parent colors . This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black . Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness , or energy level ; in painting , lightness is adjusted through mixture with white , black or a color 's complement . \n \n It is common among some artistic painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called shades—or to lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called tints . However , this is not always the best way for representational painting , since an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in their hues . For instance , darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows , reds and oranges , to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum . Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges . Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite , or complementary , color ( e.g . violet-purple added to yellowish-green ) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue , and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color . When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color ( e.g . adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum ) .",

The term is also used to describe dresses and coats with a similar shape . [ http : //www.wwd.com/fashion-resources/fashion-dictionary Women 's Wear Daily : Glossary ] \n \n History \n \n The term was first used by the French couture designer Christian Dior as the label for his collection of spring 1955 . The A-Line collection 's feature item , then the `` most wanted silhouette in Paris '' , was a `` fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full , pleated skirt '' . \n \n Although an A-shape , this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A-line idea . That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Dior ’ s successor , Yves Saint Laurent , with his `` Trapeze Line '' of spring 1958 , which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line . \n \n A-line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s , disappeared from fashion almost completely by the early 1980s and were revived by the retro trend of the late 1990s . By that time , `` A-line '' was used more loosely to describe any dress wider at the hips than at the bust or waist , as well as a number of flared skirt styles . `` True '' A-line shapes on the pattern of Dior and Saint Laurent saw a revival in the early 2000s . \n \n Style details \n \n The A-line skirt has no visible embellishments for ease , such as pleats or slits , but is fitted to the upper hip by means of seams and/or darts . However , denim A-line skirts often have buttons down the center seam . Its fastening is usually kept discreet , with a side or back zipper . A belt is sometimes used . Pockets may be present , but not usually . The length of an A-line skirt varies , between mini- and below-knee-length . \n \n When referring to dresses and coats , the term A-line generally means fitted from the shoulders to the hips and then widening to the hem , but it is also sometimes used to mean widening from the shoulders to the hem , ignoring the waist and hips . \n \n It is often used to describe a popular style of wedding dress , which is fitted above and around the hips but flares gently to the hem , giving a streamlined and quite slim look . \n \n Notes",

The song also topped the charts in Canada , and reached # 2 in both the UK Singles Chart and Irish Singles Chart in February 1970 . \n \n John Denver recorded his own version of the song for his debut solo album , Rhymes & Reasons , and re-recorded it in 1973 for John Denver 's Greatest Hits . His version was featured in the end credits of The Guard . \n \n Cover versions \n \n The song was also recorded in 1967 by the Chad Mitchell Trio and then later that same year by Spanky and Our Gang . It was performed for the very first time live at The Cellar Door in Washington , D.C. in 1966 by the Chad Mitchell Trio , with Denver substituting for Chad Mitchell . \n \n In 1968 Welsh vocal harmony group Y Triban recorded a Welsh language version entitled `` Gadael '' , with \n words by Caryl Owen , for their EP `` Paid A Dodi Dadi Ar Y Dôl '' , on the Cambrian Records label . The following year they recorded the orignal song , in English , as a single for the same label . \n \n In the 1980s the song prompted litigation involving the British group New Order . The band 's single `` Run 2 '' ( 1989 ) was the subject of a lawsuit brought by John Denver , who argued that its wordless guitar break was based on his `` Leaving on a Jet Plane '' . An out-of-court settlement ensured that the song would never be re-released in its original form . \n \n In 1998 Canadian singer Chantal Kreviazuk recorded a cover of the song , which was featured on the soundtrack of the film Armageddon . \n \n Charts",

These new facilities are currently being phased in and includes the forementioned retaking of the name Rivington Services .

Hesselius writes letters to a Dutch colleague about the victim 's condition , which gets steadily worse with time as the creature steps up its methods , all of which are purely psychological .

The Siege Perilous is so strictly reserved that it is fatal to anyone else who sits in it . Another version of this story is related in Alfred , Lord Tennyson 's Idylls of the King . \n \n Originally , this motif about the seat and the grail belonged to Perceval , but the Lancelot-Grail Cycle transferred it to the new Cistercian-based hero Galahad . It appears , for example , in the earlier de Boron Didot Perceval , where Perceval occupies the seat at Arthur 's court at Carduel . According to many scholars , the motif of the dangerous seat can be further traced to Welsh , Cornish , and Breton mythology , where the bulk of the Arthurian legend was derived from . According to this theory , the Siege Perilous was a half-remembered version of a Celtic kingship ritual that has parallels in the Irish Lia Fail .",

The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College is referred to as UVM , after the Latin Universitas Viridis Montis ( University of the Green Mountains ) . \n \n Geology and physiography \n \n The Green Mountains are a physiographic section of the larger New England province , which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division . \n \n Lemon Fair runs through the towns of Orwell , Sudbury , Shoreham , Bridport , and Cornwall , Vermont , before flowing into Otter Creek . The story is that its name derives from early English-speaking settlers ' phonetic approximation of 'Les Monts Vert ' .",

          "context": "The earliest known mention of a Liverpool Tart is 1897 , when it was hand-written into a family cookbook , which was recently included in the village website for Evershot , in Dorset . \n \n Basically a pasty tart , the distinctive taste comes from the mixture of moist sugar ( sic ) and a boiled lemon , minced . In 2006 this recipe was taken up by Gerry Jones of Liverpool and developed with a view to the tart becoming as widely known and appreciated as the Bakewell and Manchester tarts . In 2008 it was being produced as a regular line by two bakeries in Merseyside , Satterthwaites in Crosby and Dafna 's Cheesecake Factory in south Liverpool . The original recipe called for `` ½lb moist sugar , 2oz butter , 1 egg , 1 lemon , pastry '' . \n \n The process read ; \n `` Put the butter and sugar into a moderate oven to melt . When melted , let it cool . Boil your lemon whole very slowly ( or it will break ) until quite soft . Mince it whole as it is , saving the juice as much as possible and taking out the pips . Mince very fine . \n \n Beat the egg well . Mix all well together . Line a flat open tart dish with good paste , and pour in the mixture to one uniform thickness ( about ½ an inch ) , cross bar over and bake . Serve hot or cold . '' \n \n Current thinking is that `` moist '' sugar meant dark muscovado , while the lemon may be shredded ( after removal of the pips ) instead of `` boiling and mincing '' . Once the basic tart is baked and setting , thought is then given to a decorative finish . The original `` cross bar over '' is generally agreed to mean a lattice of pastry strips across the top , but the most attractive versions include the shape of Liverpool 's Liver Bird in one form or another . It is possible to buy bespoke pastry cutters which can provide Liver Bird shapes in sugarpaste . While these produce the most attractive tarts , they do add yet another level of sweetness , and the difficulty of removing each limb from the cutter makes this uneconomical in commercial terms . Another popular method is to acquire a flat Liver Bird shape or template , which can be rested on the surface while biscuit-crumb is dredged over the whole tart , then removal of the template leaves a dark Liver Bird in clear view . This is a much quicker process and adds much less extra sweetness .",

They originally called it the `` High IQ Club '' . Lance Ware had the initial idea for the society , but Berrill founded Mensa in the usual sense : he supplied the start-up cash , wrote some initial idiosyncratic pamphlets and became Mensa 's first Secretary . \n \n Berrill was an unashamed elitist , who regretted the passing of an aristocratic tradition . He regarded Mensa as `` an aristocracy of the intellect '' . He noticed with some disappointment that a majority of Mensans appeared to have come from humble homes . \n \n At an early Mensa organizational meeting , one of the people present proposed that black people be excluded from Mensa . This was met by shocked silence . Then Berrill proposed that the motion be amended to exclude `` green people with yellow stripes '' instead . This amended motion passed , with one vote against . If the minutes of that meeting had not been lost , that statute might still be on the books of Mensa . \n \n Berrill died a few years later , having recruited in total around 400 people by self-administered IQ tests . \n \n Personal life \n \n Berrill was born in Australia in 1897 , but left with his family in 1901 and went to London . Although he was called to the bar , he never practised as a barrister but lived on the dividends of his investments . \n \n He spent most of the rest of his life in England . He had brief trips to Tangier in 1936 , New York in 1937 and Durban , South Africa in 1959 . On November 22 , 1948 , he spoke at the Socratic Club in Oxford , combining with Father Victor White , on the topic `` Beyond Myth and Dogma '' at Lady Margaret Hall . \n \n Berrill was thick-set and sturdy , with a full well-tended dark beard and moustache . He had confident , protruding eyes , and firm , pleasant voice that revealed his English upper-class schooling , not his antipodean birth . He believed in palmistry , phrenology , astrology and dianetics . These views were not popular within Mensa , and he was regarded by Mensans as `` deficient in normal scepticism '' . \n \n Berrill was a member of The Men 's Dress Reform Movement ; he desired more colour in men 's clothes , and objected to the uniformity common in those days . He never married .",

          "context": "Rollfilm or roll film is any type of spool-wound photographic film protected from white light exposure by a paper backing , as opposed to film which is protected from exposure and wound forward in a cartridge . The term originated in contrast to sheet film . Confusingly , roll film was originally often referred to as `` cartridge '' film because of its resemblance to a shotgun cartridge . The opaque backing paper allows roll film to be loaded in daylight . It is typically printed with frame number markings which can be viewed through a small red window at the rear of the camera . A spool of roll film is usually loaded on one side of the camera and pulled across to an identical take up spool on the other side of the shutter as exposures are made . When the roll is fully exposed , the take up spool is removed for processing and the empty spool on which the film was originally wound is moved to the other side , becoming the take up spool for the next roll of film . \n \n History \n \n In 1881 a farmer in Cambria , Wisconsin , Peter Houston , invented the first roll film camera . His younger brother David , filed the patents for various components of Peter 's camera . \n David Henderson Houston ( b. June 14 , 1841 ; d. May 6 , 1906 \n ) , originally from Cambria , Wisconsin , patented the first holders for flexible roll film . Houston moved to Hunter in Dakota Territory in 1880 . He was issued an 1881 patent for a roll film holder which he licensed to George Eastman ( it was used in Eastman 's Kodak 1888 box camera ) . Houston sold the patent ( and an 1886 revision ) outright to Eastman for $ 5000 in 1889 . Houston continued developing the camera , creating 21 patents for cameras or camera parts between 1881 and 1902 . In 1912 his estate transferred the remainder of his patents to Eastman . \n \n The most popular rollfilm is the type 120 film format , which is used in most medium-format cameras and roll film magazines for large-format cameras . Until the 1950s , 120 roll film was also used in the then most simplist of snapshot cameras , and box cameras . The use of roll film in consumer cameras was largely superseded by 135 and 126 cartridges , but 120 and 220 ( double length ) film are still commonly used in medium-format cameras .",

If play is halted for any reason other than stepping off the side of the piste a fencer may never be replaced on guard behind the rear line . \n \n After each touch , fencers begin again at the en garde line , 4 metres apart , or if these lines are not available , roughly at a position where their blades can nearly touch when fully extended . If no touch is scored but play was halted , the fencers come en garde at the position they were stopped . \n \n Most pistes at fencing tournaments are `` grounded '' to the scoring box , thus any hits that a fencer makes against the piste will not be registered as a touch . \n \n Types of piste \n \n There are different types of piste : \n \n 1 .

Alice Cooper claims his song `` The Man With The Golden Gun '' was to be used by the film 's producers until it was dropped for Lulu 's song instead . Cooper 's song appears on his album Muscle of Love . \n \n Barry considered the theme tune – the only Bond film title track not to chart as a single in either the U.K. or U.S. – and score to be among the weakest of his contributions to the series : `` It 's the one I hate most ... it just never happened for me . '' Certainly the title song is notable for having suggestive lyrics , and during a TV celebration for the series ' 40th anniversary , Lulu 's performance was introduced with reference to its being the raunchiest of all Bond songs . For the first time , the song 's end theme is not a straight reprise of the opener , as it begins with different lyrics ( subsequent films followed suit with variations in arrangement , ahead of a new practice of using a different song altogether ) . Some Bond music fans consider Lulu 's brassy vocal to be effective in setting the tone for the film 's female characters . \n \n The film was also the first to drop the distinctive plucked guitar from the Bond theme heard over the gun barrel sequence - in all subsequent John Barry James Bond scores , this theme would be heard on strings and trumpet . Not present on the album but heard in the film is a brief reprise , for recognition purposes , of the song `` Live and Let Die '' when a character ( Sheriff JW Pepper ) from the previous film reappears .

New growth develops from living tissues remaining on or under the ground , including roots , a caudex ( a thickened portion of the stem at ground level ) or various types of underground stems , such as bulbs , corms , stolons , rhizomes and tubers . Examples of herbaceous biennials include carrot , parsnip and common ragwort ; herbaceous perennials include potato , peony , hosta , mint , most ferns and most grasses . By contrast , non-herbaceous perennial plants are woody plants which have stems above ground that remain alive during the dormant season and grow shoots the next year from the above-ground parts – these include trees , shrubs and vines . \n \n Some relatively fast-growing herbaceous plants ( especially annuals ) are pioneers , or early-successional species . Others form the main vegetation of many stable habitats , occurring for example in the ground layer of forests , or in naturally open habitats such as meadow , salt marsh or desert . \n \n Some herbaceous plants can grow rather large , such as the Musa genus , to which the banana belongs . \n \n The age of some herbaceous perennial plants can be determined by analyzing annual growth rings in the secondary root xylem , a method called herbchronology .",

          "context": "Calcium ( Ca ) deficiency is a plant disorder that can be caused by insufficient calcium in the growing medium , but is more frequently a product of low transpiration of the whole plant or more commonly the affected tissue . Plants are susceptible to such localized calcium deficiencies in low or nontranspiring tissues because calcium is not transported in the phloem . This may be due to water shortages , which slow the transportation of calcium to the plant , poor uptake of calcium through the stem , or too much nitrogen in the soil . \n \n Causes \n \n Acidic , sandy , or coarse soils often contain less calcium . Uneven soil moisture and overuse of fertilizers can also cause calcium deficiency . At times , even with sufficient calcium in the soil , it can be in an insoluble form and is then unusable by the plant or it could be attributed to a `` transport protein '' . Soils containing high phosphorus are particularly susceptible to creating insoluble forms of calcium . \n \n Symptoms \n \n Calcium deficiency symptoms appear initially as localized tissue necrosis leading to stunted plant growth , necrotic leaf margins on young leaves or curling of the leaves , and eventual death of terminal buds and root tips . Generally , the new growth and rapidly growing tissues of the plant are affected first . The mature leaves are rarely if ever affected because calcium accumulates to high concentrations in older leaves . \n \n Crop-specific symptoms include : \n ; Apple : 'Bitter pit ' – fruit skins develop pits , brown spots appear on skin and/or in flesh and taste of those areas is bitter . This usually occurs when fruit is in storage , and Bramley apples are particularly susceptible . Related to boron deficiency , `` water cored '' apples seldom display bitter pit effects . \n ; Cabbage and Brussels sprouts : Internal browning and `` tip burn '' \n ; Carrot : 'Cavity spot ' – oval spots develop into craters which may be invaded by other disease-causing organisms . \n ; Celery : Stunted growth , central leaves stunted . \n ; Tomatoes and peppers : 'Blossom end rot ' – Symptoms start as sunken , dry decaying areas at the blossom end of the fruit , furthest away from the stem , not all fruit on a truss is necessarily affected . Sometimes rapid growth from high-nitrogen fertilizers may exacerbate blossom end rot . \n \n Treatment \n \n Calcium deficiency can sometimes be rectified by adding agricultural lime to acid soils , aiming at a pH of 6.5 , unless the subject plants specifically prefer acidic soil . Organic matter should be added to the soil to improve its moisture-retaining capacity . However , because of the nature of the disorder ( i.e . poor transport of calcium to low transpiring tissues ) , the problem can not generally be cured by the addition of calcium to the roots . In some species , the problem can be reduced by prophylactic spraying with calcium chloride of tissues at risk . \n \n Plant damage is difficult to reverse , so corrective action should be taken immediately , supplemental applications of calcium nitrate at 200 ppm nitrogen , for example . Soil pH should be tested , and corrected if needed , because calcium deficiency is often associated with low pH .",

The subtitle is `` A Tale of Two Campuses '' , and thus both the title and subtitle are literary allusions to Charles Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities . It is the first text in Lodge 's 'Campus Trilogy ' of novels , followed by Small World ( 1984 ) and Nice Work ( 1988 ) . \n \n Synopsis \n \n Changing Places is a comic novel with serious undercurrents . It tells the story of the six-month academic exchange program between fictional universities located in Rummidge ( modelled on Birmingham in England ) and Plotinus , in the state of Euphoria ( modeled on Berkeley in California ) . The two academics taking part in the exchange are both aged 40 , but appear at first to otherwise have little in common , mainly because of the differing academic systems of their native countries . \n \n The English participant , Philip Swallow , is a very conventional and conformist British academic , and somewhat in awe of the American way of life . By contrast the American , Morris Zapp , is a top-ranking American professor who only agrees to go to Rummidge because his wife agrees to postpone long-threatened divorce proceedings on condition that he move out of the marital home for six months . Zapp is at first both contemptuous of , and amused by , what he perceives as the amateurism of British academia . \n \n As the exchange progresses , however , both Swallow and Zapp find that they begin to fit in surprisingly well to their new environments . In the course of the story , each man has an affair with the other 's wife . Before that , Swallow sleeps with Zapp 's daughter Melanie , without realizing who she is . She , however , takes up with a former undergraduate student of his , Charles Boon . \n \n Swallow and Zapp even consider remaining permanently . The book ends with the two couples convened in a New York hotel room to decide their fates . The novel ends without a clear-cut decision , though the sequel Small World : An Academic Romance , reveals that Swallow and Zapp returned to their respective countries and domestic situations . \n \n Biographical basis \n \n David Lodge has stated that the character of Morris Zapp was inspired by the literary critic Stanley Fish .",

In 1989 it was made into a four-part BBC television series directed by Christopher Menaul and starring Warren Clarke and Haydn Gwynne . The University of Birmingham served as the filming location of many of the scenes from this series . \n \n Plot summary \n \n The book describes encounters between Robyn Penrose , a feminist university teacher specialising in the industrial novel and women 's writing , and Vic Wilcox , the manager of an engineering firm . The relationship that develops between the unlikely pair reveals the weaknesses in each character . Robyn 's academic position is precarious because of budget cuts . Vic has to deal with industrial politics at his firm . \n \n The plot is a pastiche of the industrial novel genre , particularly referencing North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell . This gentle ribbing acts to undermine the postmodern and feminist position of Robyn , who accepts the hand of fate despite ridiculing its role as the sole restorative capable ( in the minds of authors of industrial novels ) of elevating the female to a serious social position . Robyn acquires insight into the pragmatic ethos whose encroachment on university culture she resents and Vic learns to appreciate the symbolic or semiotic dimension of his environment and discovers a romanticism within himself that he had previously despised in his everyday life . \n \n The story is set in the fictional city of Rummidge , a grey and dismal fictionalised Birmingham . It is part of the same series as the novels Changing Places , Small World , and Thinks ... ( though strangely the latter makes reference to the `` University of Birmingham '' - suggesting that Birmingham is distinct from Rummidge even in the fictional world ) . In Nice Work , Philip Swallow is still head of the English Department from Small World and thus is Robyn Penrose 's boss . Morris Zapp makes a cameo appearance in the last part of Nice Work , to add a plot twist where he tries to arrange for Robyn to have a job interview at his American university , Euphoric State ( a fictionalized UC Berkeley ) , in order to stop his ex-wife from being a candidate for an open faculty position . Robyn Penrose makes a cameo appearance in Thinks .... \n \n Adaptations \n \n The BBC broadcast a TV miniseries based on the novel , which was the winner of the 1989 Royal Television Society award for best drama series .",

It sits within a mile of the San Andreas Rift Zone fault line at an elevation of 1157 ft above sea level and is located at . Cholame is reached via State Route 41 , just southwest of the junction of Route 46 . Rainfall data from a nearby ranch shows that the area around Cholame only receives about eight to nine inches ( 200–230 mm ) of rain in a normal year . \n \n Cholame is locally pronounced `` show-LAM . '' \n \n History \n \n Cholame was originally a rancheria of the Salinian Indians , Rancho Cholame was an 1844 Mexican land grant . In 1867 William Welles Hollister ( 1818–1886 ) purchased Rancho Cholame . Hollister sold a half interest in the rancho to Robert Edgar Jack in 1869.Dan Krieger , `` Ranch Near Where James Dean Died in Crash Has a Long History , '' San Luis Obispo Tribune , May 17 , 2015 , page B3 ] \n \n Jack studied at Maine Wesleyan Seminary , and he later was an accountant at a shipping house in New York City . In the Civil War he enlisted in the 56th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment , and he served in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , during the Battle of Gettsyburg and then in New York to quell `` anti-Negro riots '' there . Near the end of the war he removed to California and became Hollister 's accountant and secretary on the latter 's San Justo Ranch surrounding the present city of Hollister . When that property was subdivided , the two bought the Cholame land . Jack married Hollister 's daughter , Lucy Ellen ( Nellie ) in 1870 and became the largest wool grower in Central California , later switching to cattle and agriculture . Jack organized the County Bank of San Luis Obispo . \n \n The land was sold to the Hearst Corporation in 1966 and is still a working cattle ranch.David W. Kean , 1993 , Wide Places in the California Roads : The encyclopedia of California 's small towns and the roads that lead to them ( Volume 1 of 4 : Southern California Counties ) , pp . 44-45 . ISBN 1884261000 \n \n James Dean \n \n On September 30 , 1955 , actor James Dean was killed in a traffic collision when college student Donald Turnupseed made a left turn without seeing Dean 's Porsche 550 Spyder approaching at the junction of State Highways 41 and 46 . On the same date in 2005 , the State of California observed the 50th anniversary of Dean 's death by naming the intersection as the James Dean Memorial Junction . A few hundred people , including state officials , a Dean family member , several Dean archivists and fans gathered at the junction and in Cholame to pay tribute to the actor . Near a local restaurant a memorial to Dean was erected in 1977 by a retired Japanese businessman from Kobe , Seita Ohnishi . The monument is made of stainless steel and surrounds a tree of heaven , a Chinese sumac .",

Like other contemporary administrative units , they are defined by the Local Autonomy Law of 1947 . \n \n City status \n \n Article 8 of the Local Autonomy Law sets the following conditions for a municipality to be designated as a city : \n \n * Population must generally be 50,000 or greater ( 原則として人口5万人以上 ) \n * At least 60 % of households must be established in a central urban area ( 中心市街地の戸数が全戸数の6割以上 ) \n * At least 60 % of households must be employed in commerce , industry or other urban occupations ( 商工業等の都市的業態に従事する世帯人口が全人口の6割以上 ) \n * Any other conditions set by prefectural ordinance must be satisfied ( 他に当該都道府県の条例で定める要件を満たしていること ) \n \n The designation is approved by the prefectural governor and the Minister for Internal Affairs . \n \n A city can theoretically be demoted to a town or village when it fails to meet any of these conditions , but such a demotion has not happened to date . The least populous city , Utashinai , Hokkaido , has a population of six thousand , while a town in the same prefecture , Otofuke , Hokkaido , has nearly forty thousand . \n \n Under the , the standard of 50,000 inhabitants for the city status has been eased to 30,000 if such population is gained as a result of a merger of towns and/or villages , in order to facilitate such mergers to reduce administrative costs . Many municipalities gained city status under this eased standard . On the other hand , the municipalities recently gained the city status purely as a result of increase of population without expansion of area are limited to those listed in List of former towns or villages gained city status alone in Japan . \n \n Classifications for large cities \n \n The Cabinet of Japan can designate cities of at least 200,000 inhabitants to have the status of special city , core city , or designated city . These statuses expand the scope of administrative authority delegated from the prefectural government to the city government . \n \n Status of Tokyo \n \n Tokyo , Japan ’ s capital , existed as a city until 1943 , but is now legally classified as a special type of prefecture called a . The 23 special wards of Tokyo , which constitute the core of the Tokyo metropolitan area , each have an administrative status analogous to that of cities . Tokyo also has several other incorporated cities , towns and villages within its jurisdiction .",

          "context": "Perpetual Motion is a Patience game which has the objective of discarding playing cards from the tableau . It is also called Idiot 's Delight because of the time-consuming process of the game . \n \n Rules \n \n The tableau is made up of four piles/columns . Four cards are dealt ( the rest are left aside as the stock ) , one in each pile . If there are cards of equal rank ( such as three kings ) , the duplicates are moved to the leftmost pile with an equal card . \n \n Example : The three kings mentioned are found at piles 2 , 3 , and 4 . The kings in piles 3 and 4 are moved to pile 2 . \n \n After that , four cards are again dealt from the stock ( even if one pile is empty ) and plays already mentioned are made . Only the top card of each pile is in play . In case the four cards dealt from the stock are all of the same rank , they are immediately discarded . \n \n This continues until the stock runs out . After this first round , the piles are picked up , starting from the rightmost pile , and put over one another either faced down or face up without disturbing the order of the cards in each pile . Four cards are again dealt and the steps mentioned earlier are again done . \n \n The game is won when all cards are discarded ( in fours ) . This is not always possible , however , since in about 45 % of cases a cycle occurs : that is , the cards return to exactly the same sequence as one that has been seen previously . When the game can be won , it still takes an average of 128 rounds before completion , hence the name . \n \n Variants \n \n Idiot 's Delight ( Alternate Rules ) \n \n An alternate way to play , as suggested by Peter Drake in his book `` Data Structures and Algorithms in Java '' , is as follows : \n \n The object is still to remove all the cards from the table , but the methods are slightly different . \n \n Play begins by dealing four cards into four separate stacks , one card in each stack . The rest of the cards are kept aside as stock . A player may do one of three things : \n \n * If there are two cards of the same rank showing , discard both of them \n * If there are two cards of the same suit showing , discard the one with the lower rank \n * If neither of those conditions exist , deal four new cards , one on top of each stack . \n \n Similar to perpetual motion , this continues until the stock runs out and no more removals can be made . \n \n Games will obviously end much sooner than with Perpetual Motion , but considering that the game can only end if the last two cards are of the same rank , the odds of winning are not in the player 's favour .",

Originally a Georgian farmhouse , it has Victorian and later additions , and was rebuilt after a fire in 1910 . It was given to the National Trust by Lord Courtauld-Thomson in 1947 as a country home for a senior member of the Government , usually a Secretary of State or Minister of the Crown . The Dorneywood Trust has the objective of 'maintaining the mansion house and gardens of Dorneywood ' . \n \n Occupancy of the house \n \n The Prime Minister alone decides which Minister or Secretary of State is to occupy the house . In previous administrations it has been the residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and , prior to 31 May 2006 , was occupied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott . Prescott was forced to relinquish occupancy of Dorneywood , following a series of scandals over an affair with civil servant Tracey Temple and a snatched paparazzi photograph of him playing croquet on the lawn of the property whilst the Prime Minister Tony Blair was out of the country on a visit to Washington . However , given the controversies over John Prescott 's use of the house , senior politicians were reluctant to use it . The house was eventually taken over by Alistair Darling , Chancellor of the Exchequer when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in 2007 . `` A spokesman for Mr Brown ... explained that the house ... was owned by a trust , and would revert first to the Lord Mayor of London and then to the American Ambassador , if the Chancellor did not want it '' . \n \n Various former Prime Ministers ( before achieving the premiership ) have occupied the house , among them Anthony Eden ; he and his wife had disliked the house . However , on becoming Prime Minister , Alec Douglas-Home was reluctant to forsake the more comfortable and modern Dorneywood for the antique splendours of Chequers . Another , James Callaghan as Foreign Secretary , also had the use of Dorneywood ( later Chevening was to become the official country home for the holder of that office ) . The last person to have lived at the house before becoming Prime Minister was John Major . \n \n In 2010 , George Osborne , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , took occupancy of the house . \n \n Dorneywood is now used by Osborne 's successor , Philip Hammond . \n \n Interior \n \n The interior of the house contains some decorations by Rex Whistler , as well as paintings and furniture belonging to the Government Art Collection . There is also furniture belonging to the National Trust . The house is only open to the public on selected dates . \n \n Grounds \n \n The National Trust markets the property under the name `` Dorneywood Garden '' . The estate consists of the house and 215 acres of parkland , woodland and farmland . The 1930s-style gardens are open to the public on selected dates during the summer . The grounds are noted for their cottage and kitchen garden , as well as their herbaceous borders and rose displays . The upkeep of the estate is in part supported by the Dorneywood Thomson Endowment Trust Fund .",

Other names include felinophobia , elurophobia , and cat phobia . \n \n Description \n \n The phobia manifests itself in different ways . For most people it is less about fear than about loathing , similar to the reaction many people have to snakes or rats . Some people experience it almost all the time , others just in response to direct stimuli . Some possible situations that can trigger the loathing of cats are : hearing purring , seeing a cat in real life , imagining the possibility of a cat touching or rubbing against one , the thought of meeting a cat in the dark , seeing the staring eyes of a cat ( cats have the tendency to stare at passers-by ) cats in pictures and on television , and cat-like toys and cat-like fur . Big cats such as lions or tigers can also trigger the stimuli associated with a phobia . \n \n Treatment \n \n There are many ways to treat ailurophobia ; treatment is usually carried out by a psychiatrist or other therapy specialist . \n \n One strongly motivated patient was able to recover by slowly becoming accustomed to cat fur by first touching varying types of velvet , then becoming accustomed to a toy kitten , and finally a live kitten which the patient subsequently adopted . \n \n In popular culture \n \n In the 1965 animated television special A Charlie Brown Christmas , the character Lucy lists a number of phobias and incorrectly states , `` If you ’ re afraid of cats , you have ailurophasia. ``",

Unlike the Tri-Nations series , there was no final ; the team finishing at the top of the group was deemed the winner . From 1949 to 1956 , a fourth Other Nationalities team entered the European Cup . \n \n From 2003 to 2009 , the tournament featured six teams , including Ireland and Scotland . Since 2014 , the European Cup is contested with four teams and the most recent was held in 2015 . It is run by the Rugby League European Federation . \n \n History \n \n The tournament was initially played annually , with the exception of the years of the Second World War . In 1946–47 , the tournament was altered , with each team playing each other twice , at home and away . The 1949–50 season saw a return to playing only once , but a new team , `` Other Nationalities '' , was added . This team consisted of players who were not English , Welsh , or French playing in the British and French leagues : Australian , New Zealand , Scottish , Irish players , and others all played for this new side . \n \n The 1955–56 tournament had no Welsh team , though Welsh players featured for Other Nationalities . The tournament was not played again until 1969–70 . It was revived in 1975 , with the three-team format of England , Wales and France playing each other team only once being made standard . The tournament was cancelled after 1981 , but it was revived under the same format for 1995 and 1996 . \n \n The tournament was revamped for 2003 , with Scotland , Ireland and Russia all joining . The new structure saw two groups of three , with the winner of each group meeting in a final . This structure was continued for the 2004 tournament . \n \n From 2004 Scotland , Ireland and Wales had to have at least four 'home grown ' players from their domestic competitions ( in the case of Wales this means Welsh clubs playing in the TotalRLConference ) in their squad . Effectively this means that at least one home grown player is guaranteed a start . \n \n The 2005 tournament did not include England as a participant ; England will instead play matches against France and New Zealand , giving the European Nations Cup a more level playing field . Georgia won the first ever European Nations qualifying tournament in 2005 , beating both Serbia and the Netherlands to win a spot in the tournament . \n \n Starting from 2010 the tournament will be used to choose the team that compete with Australia , New Zealand and England in the Four Nations . \n \n Participants \n \n * England Knights competed in 2012 \n * Bold- team still competes \n \n Results \n \n * Wales qualified for the 2011 Four Nations . \n * Scotland qualified for the 2016 Four Nations . \n \n Total wins",

          "context": "The Wooden Prince ( ) Op . 13 , Sz . 60 , is a one-act pantomime ballet composed by Béla Bartók in 1914-1916 ( orchestrated 1916-1917 ) to a scenario by Béla Balázs . It was first performed at the Budapest Opera on 12 May 1917 under the conductor Egisto Tango . \n \n The work \n \n The Wooden Prince has never achieved the fame of Bartók 's other ballet , The Miraculous Mandarin ( 1926 ) , but it was enough of a success at its premiere to prompt the Opera House to stage Bartók 's opera , Bluebeard 's Castle the following year ( it had been waiting for a performance since 1911 ) . Like Bluebeard , The Wooden Prince uses a huge orchestra ( it even includes saxophones ) , though the critic Paul Griffiths believes it sounds like an earlier work in style ( Griffiths p. 71 ) . The music shows the influence of Debussy and Richard Strauss , as well as Wagner ( the introduction echoes the prelude of Das Rheingold ) . Bartók used a scenario by the poet Béla Balázs , which had appeared in the influential literary journal Nyugat in 1912 . \n \n Instrumentation \n \n This is probably the work in which Bartók uses his largest orchestra : \n \n * Woodwinds : 4 flutes ( third doubling on piccolo 2 , fourth on piccolo 1 ) , 4 oboes ( third on English horn 2 , fourth on English horn 1 ) , 4 clarinets ( third doubling on sopranino clarinet , fourth on bass clarinet ) , 4 bassoons ( third and fourth doubling on contrabassoons ) , Alto saxophone in E flat , tenor saxophone in B flat ( doubling on baritone saxophone in E flat ) \n * Brass : 4 horns , 6 trumpets ( 4 trumpets and 2 cornets , all in B flat ) , 3 trombones , tuba \n * Percussion ( timpanist and 5 players ) : timpani , bass drum , cymbals , snare drum , field drum , triangle , tam-tam , glockenspiel , xylophone , castanets \n * 2 harps , celesta for 4 hands \n * strings : 16 first and 16 second violins , 12 violas , 10 cellos , 8 double basses \n \n Synopsis \n \n A prince falls in love with a princess , but is stopped from reaching her by a fairy who makes a forest and a stream rise against him . To attract the princess ' attention , the prince hangs his cloak on a staff and fixes a crown and locks of his hair to it . The princess catches sight of this `` wooden prince '' and comes to dance with it . The fairy brings the wooden prince to life and the princess goes away with that instead of the real prince , who falls into despair . The fairy takes pity on him as he sleeps , dresses him in finery and reduces the wooden prince to lifelessness again . The princess returns and is finally united with the human prince . \n \n Recordings \n \n * The Wooden Prince ( with Cantata Profana ) Chicago Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Pierre Boulez ( Deutsche Grammophon , 1992 ) \n * The Wooden Prince ( with Kossuth ) Hungarian National Philharmonic Orchestra , conducted by Zoltán Kocsis ( Hungaroton SACD , 2007 ) \n * The Wooden Prince Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra , conducted by Marin Alsop ( Naxos , 2008 ) \n \n Sources \n \n * Paul Griffiths : Bartók ( J.M .

          "context": "Horology ( via Latin horologium from Greek , from hṓra `` hour ; time '' and -o- interfix and suffix -logy ; literally `` the study of time '' ) is the art or science of measuring time . Clocks , watches , clockwork , sundials , hourglasses , clepsydras , timers , time recorders , marine chronometers and atomic clocks are all examples of instruments used to measure time . In current usage , horology refers mainly to the study of mechanical time-keeping devices , while chronometry more broadly includes electronic devices that have largely supplanted mechanical clocks for the best accuracy and precision in time-keeping . \n \n People interested in horology are called horologists . That term is used both by people who deal professionally with timekeeping apparatus ( watchmakers , clockmakers ) , as well as aficionados and scholars of horology . Horology and horologists have numerous organizations , both professional associations and more scholarly societies . \n \n Museums and libraries \n \n There are many horology museums and several specialized libraries devoted to the subject . One example is the Royal Greenwich Observatory , which is also the source of the Prime Meridian ( longitude 0° 0 ' 0 '' ) , and the home of the first marine timekeepers accurate enough to determine longitude ( made by John Harrison ) . Other horological museums in the London area include the Clockmakers ' Museum , which re-opened at the Science Museum in October 2015 , and the horological collections at the British Museum , the Science Museum ( London ) and at the Wallace Collection . \n \n One of the more comprehensive museums dedicated to horology is the Musée international d'horlogerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds ( Switzerland ) . The Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle is smaller but located nearby . One of the better horological museums in Germany is the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Furtwangen im Schwarzwald , in the Black Forest . The two leading specialised horological museums in North America are the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia , Pennsylvania , and the American Clock and Watch Museum in Bristol , Connecticut . \n \n The eastern French city of Besançon has the Musée du Temps ( Museum of Time ) in the historic Palais Grenvelle . \n \n An example of a museum devoted to one particular type of clock is the Cuckooland Museum in the U.K. , which hosts the world 's largest collection of antique cuckoo clocks . \n \n One of the most comprehensive horological libraries open to the public is the National Watch and Clock Library in Columbia , Pennsylvania . Other good horological libraries providing public access are at the Musée international d'horlogerie in Switzerland , at the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Germany , and at the Guildhall Library in London . \n \n Another museum dedicated to clocks is the Willard House and Clock Museum in Grafton , Massachusetts . \n \n Organizations \n \n Notable scholarly horological organizations include : \n * American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute – AWCI ( United States of America ) \n * Antiquarian Horological Society – AHS ( United Kingdom ) \n * British Horological Institute – BHI ( United Kingdom ) \n * Chronometrophilia ( Switzerland ) \n * Deutsche Gesellschaft für Chronometrie – DGC ( Germany ) \n * National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors – NAWCC ( United States of America ) \n \n World exhibitions \n \n * BaselWorld \n * Geneva Time Exhibition \n * Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie ( SIHH ) \n \n Glossary",

At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the film currently holds an average score of 69 , based on 28 reviews , which indicates `` generally favorable reviews '' . In a WBEZ podcast on the best theatrical films of 2011 , critic Jonathan Rosenbaum used the series as an example of television work that was on par with the year 's best movies , calling it Haynes ' best work to date . Salon.com called it a `` quiet , heartbreaking masterpiece '' , while The New York Times reviewer , Alessandra Stanley , commented that while the miniseries was `` loyally , unwaveringly true to James M. Cain 's 1941 novel '' , it did not `` make the most of the mythic clash of mother , lover and ungrateful child '' , and was `` not nearly as satisfying as the 1945 film noir '' . \n \n Novelist Stephen King , reviewing Mildred Pierce for The Daily Beast and Newsweek , praised the acting of Winslet , Pearce and Wood , and admired the show 's attention to detail and structure , but complained that the five-hour adaptation was `` too damn long '' . He finishes with , `` Winslet ’ s Mildred is a genuine star turn . How Joan Crawford would have loathed her .

          "context": "The Harvey Wallbanger is a mixed drink made with vodka , Galliano , and orange juice . \n \n History \n \n The Harvey Wallbanger appears in literature as early as 1971 . The cocktail is reputed to have been invented in 1952 by three-time world champion mixologist Donato `` Duke '' Antone , and named by Antone after a surfer frequenting Antone 's Blackwatch Bar in Los Angeles . However , recent research by culinary historians casts doubt on this theory . Robert Simonson goes so far as to say that `` no sane person ever believed that story . '' Simonson emphasizes the lack of a historical record for any Blackwatch Bar , and indicates that , in fact , Antone lived in Hartford , Connecticut , rather than Los Angeles during the relevant period . \n \n Other historians such as David Wondrich emphasize the role of McKesson Imports Company and its marketing team for developing the drink , confirming among other things that the company commissioned a graphic artist to develop a `` Harvey Wallbanger '' sandal-clad surfer mascot in the late 1960s . It is known that McKesson executive George Bednar was instrumental in promoting the drink as a means of selling its component Galliano liqueur , and Bednar claimed to have penned a popular tagline for the drink : `` Harvey Wallbanger is the name . And I can be made ! `` . \n \n Other uses \n \n * The 1982 Milwaukee Brewers , winners of the American League pennant , were nicknamed `` Harvey 's Wallbangers , '' because of the team 's power hitting ( wall banging ) under mid-season manager Harvey Kuenn . After a mediocre 23–24 start to the season , manager Buck Rodgers was fired . Under Kuenn , the team went 72–43 ( .626 ) , led the Major Leagues in home runs and total bases , and produced the highest team OPS+ since the New York Yankees . \n * The SAS sometimes referred to C4 explosive charges as `` Harvey Wall-bangers . '' \n * Harvey Wallbanger is sometimes used to refer to the Wall Follower maze solving algorithm . \n * Harvey Wallbanger was the puppet character who ran the `` dead-letter '' post office on the Canadian children 's show , The Hilarious House of Frightenstein . \n * Harvey Wallbanger was the drink ordered by a character on the train in the 2010 movie Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz . \n * The Movie See No Evil , Hear No Evil includes the lines : \n \n Do you like Harvey Wallbangers ? \n Harvey who ? \n Wallbangers , a friend of mine . \n I 'll introduce you later . \n * The character Sven , from Class of '77 , gets constantly drunk due to his love of Harvey Wallbangers . \n * In CB lingo , a Harvey Wallbanger is a drunk driver ; specifically , one who continually drifts across the road from one shoulder to the other and back .",

          "context": "`` I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus '' is a Christmas song with music and lyrics by British songwriter Tommie Connor . \n Original Version- Jimmy Boyd \n \n The original recording by Jimmy Boyd , recorded on July 15 , 1952 when he was 13 years old , reached No . 1 on the Billboard pop singles chart in December 1952 , and on the Cash Box chart at the beginning of the following year . It later reached Number 3 in the UK Charts when issued there in November 1953 . The song was commissioned by Saks Fifth Avenue to promote the store 's Christmas card for the year , which featured an original sketch by artist Perry Barlow , who drew for The New Yorker for many decades . \n \n The song describes a scene where a child walks downstairs from his bedroom on Christmas Eve to see his mother kissing `` Santa Claus '' under the mistletoe . \n \n Boyd 's record was condemned by the Roman Catholic Church in Boston when it was released on the grounds that it mixed kissing with Christmas . Boyd was photographed meeting with the Archdiocese to explain the song . After the meeting , the ban was lifted . \n \n Spike Jones version \n \n A less successful version of the song was released in 1952 by Spike Jones ( with vocal by George Rock in the little boy voice used in Spike 's hit `` All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth '' ) . Jones also recorded a parody for his personal pleasure titled `` I Saw Mommy Screwing Santa Claus . '' \n \n Rugrats Version \n \n The Rugrats character , Tommy Pickles , performed the song in the 2004 album Rugrats Holiday Classics . \n \n Cover versions \n \n Popular versions of the song were released by the Ronettes , Molly Bee , Bobby Sherman , Andy Williams , The Beverley Sisters and The Jackson 5 . Reba McEntire , Homer and Jethro , Amy Winehouse , John Mellencamp , Mitch Miller , John Prine , Tiny Tim , The Cheetah Girls , Bif Naked , Jessica Simpson , Teresa Brewer , Rica Fukami , Secret Chiefs 3 and Dionne Bromfield have also covered it . The Dollyrots recorded a variation ( titled `` I Saw Mommy Biting Santa Claus '' ) with humorous lyrics . RuPaul and Kip Addotta both recorded versions with changed lyrics titled `` I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus '' . Swedish band Onkel Kånkel took this even further with their version `` Jag såg tomten suga pappa '' ( I saw Santa suck off daddy ) . \n \n John Mellencamp also filmed a music video to promote his recording for the 1987 Special Olympics charity album , A Very Special Christmas . \n \n International versions \n \n * Danish : `` Jeg så julemanden kysse mor '' ( Danish text : Susanne Palsbo ) \n * Finnish : `` Kun joulupukki suukon sai '' ( Finnish text : Saukki ) \n * French : J'ai vu maman embrasser le Père Noël \n * Norwegian : `` Jeg så mamma kysse nissen '' ( Norwegian text : Philip A. Kruse ) \n * Swedish : `` Jag såg mamma kyssa tomten '' ( Swedish text : Ingrid `` Ninita '' Reuterskiöld ) \n * Mexican : `` Hoy vi a Santa Claus besar a mamá '' ( Spanish text : Anibal Pastor ) \n * Icelandic : `` Ég sá mömmu kyssa jólasvein '' \n \n Film adaptation \n \n A made-for-television movie based on the song was released in 2001 . \n \n Notes and references",

          "context": "Wolframite , ( Fe , Mn ) WO4 , is an iron manganese tungstate mineral that is the intermediate between ferberite ( Fe2+ rich ) and hübnerite ( Mn2+ rich ) . Along with scheelite , the wolframite series are the most important tungsten ore minerals . Wolframite is found in quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives . Associated minerals include cassiterite , scheelite , bismuth , quartz , pyrite , galena , sphalerite , and arsenopyrite . \n \n This mineral was historically found in Europe in Bohemia , Saxony , and Cornwall . China reportedly has the world 's largest supply of tungsten ore with about 60 % . Other producers are Canada , Portugal , Russia , Australia , Thailand , South Korea , Rwanda , Bolivia , the United States , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo . \n \n Name \n \n The name `` wolframite '' is derived from German `` wolf rahm '' , the name given to tungsten by Johan Gottschalk Wallerius in 1747 . This , in turn , derives from `` Lupi spuma '' , the name Georg Agricola used for the element in 1546 , which translates into English as `` wolf 's froth '' or `` cream '' . The etymology is not entirely certain but seems to be a reference to the large amounts of tin consumed by the mineral during its extraction . Wolfram is the basis for the chemical symbol W for tungsten as a chemical element . \n \n Use \n \n Wolframite was highly valued as the main source of the metal tungsten , a strong and quite dense material with a high melting temperature used for electric filaments and armor-piercing ammunition , as well as hard tungsten carbide machine tools . In World War II , wolframite mines were a strategic asset , due to its use in munitions and tools . \n \n Wolframite is considered to be a conflict mineral due to the unethical mining practices observed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .",

West is a solo artist and also the lead singer of various groups including Tomorrow , a 1960s psychedelic rock band . West wrote most of his own songs ( credited to Keith Hopkins ) , often in collaboration with Ken Burgess . Despite critical acclaim and support from BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel , who featured them on his Perfumed Garden show , Tomorrow was not a major commercial success . \n \n In 1964 , West became lead singer of `` The In Crowd '' , a band from London , who later changed their name to Tomorrow . In 1965 The In Crowd recorded three singles for Parlophone . Another member of these groups was guitarist Steve Howe ( later of Yes ) . \n \n In 1967 West became acquainted with Mark Wirtz , a record producer who had already created the instrumental title , `` A Touch of Velvet , a Sting of Brass '' ( 1965 ) . Later on , the melody became the theme music for the German television programs , Beat-Club and Musikladen . West himself was also as a participant in Wirtz 's Teenage Opera project . He was the singer of `` Excerpt from A Teenage Opera '' , also known as `` Grocer Jack '' , which reached # 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1967 . He also performed `` Sam , '' which reached the bottom end of the UK Top 40 the same year . \n \n In August 1967 Tomorrow released a single of a Hopkins/Howe song titled Revolution a year before the more famous song Revolution written by John Lennon of The Beatles . West released the solo single `` On a Saturday '' on Parlophone in 1968 . Other musicians who appeared on the single were the guitarist Howe , bassist Ronnie Wood , and drummer Aynsley Dunbar . It has since been included on the remastered CD version of the Tomorrow album ( 1999 ) . \n \n In 1971 , West released a solo album , Wherever My Love Goes on the German progressive rock record label , Kuckuck . It featured his songwriting partner Ken Burgess and steel guitarist Glenn Ross Campbell ( ex-The Misunderstood ) . Two tracks of it were produced by Andrew Loog Oldham . \n \n By the mid 1970s , West was the lead singer for a group called Moonrider . Moonrider also featured John Weider ( Family etc . ) , Chico Greenwood ( later to perform with Murray Head ) and Bruce Thomas . Today West continues to produce and record music , which is used primarily within the advertising industry .",

When Jack unexpectedly died , the town folk reacted with anger about the inconvenience of now having to be self reliant about their staple provision , while the children were heartbroken , in truth having loved and appreciated Jack all the while .",

The table omits the time before 2500 million years ago , which is not divided into periods . \n \n Correlation issues \n \n In a steady effort ongoing since 1974 , the International Commission on Stratigraphy has been working to correlate the world 's local stratigraphic record into one uniform planet-wide benchmarked system . \n \n American geologists have long considered the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian to be periods in their own right though the ICS now recognises them both as 'subperiods ' of the Carboniferous Period recognised by European geologists . Cases like this in China , Russia and even New Zealand with other geological eras has slowed down the uniform organization of the stratigraphic record . \n \n Notable changes \n * Changes in recent years have included the abandonment of the former Tertiary Period in favour of the Paleogene and succeeding Neogene periods . \n * The abandonment of the Quaternary period was also considered but it has been retained for continuity reasons . \n * Even earlier in the history of the science , the Tertiary was considered to be an 'era ' and its subdivisions ( Paleocene , Eocene , Oligocene , Miocene and Pliocene ) were themselves referred to as 'periods ' but they now enjoy the status of 'epochs ' within the more recently delineated Paleogene and Neogene periods .",

Its first section opened in 1863 , making it the oldest underground metro system in the world – although in fact approximately 55 % of the current network is above ground , as it generally runs on the surface in outlying suburbs . The system comprises 11 lines – Bakerloo , Central , Circle , District , Hammersmith & City , Jubilee , Metropolitan , Northern , Piccadilly , Victoria , Waterloo & City – serving 270 stations . It is operated by Transport for London ( TfL ) . \n \n Most of the system is north of the River Thames , with six London boroughs in the south of the city not served by the Underground . The London Borough of Hackney , to the north , has two stations on its border . Some stations at the north-eastern end of the Central line are in the Epping Forest district of Essex and some stations at the north-western end of the Metropolitan line are in the Three Rivers and Watford districts of Hertfordshire and the Chiltern district of Buckinghamshire . \n \n There are two instances where two separate stations share the same name : there is one Edgware Road station on the Circle , District and Hammersmith & City lines and another Edgware Road on the Bakerloo line , and there is one Hammersmith station on the District and Piccadilly lines and another Hammersmith station on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines . Although the Hammersmith & City line platforms at Paddington are on the other side of the main line station from the platforms of the other Underground lines , it is treated as a single station . Paddington is shown this way on the current Tube map but has been shown as two separate stations at different times in the past . \n \n TfL plans to open six new stations between 2017 and 2020 as a result of extensions to the Metropolitan and Northern lines . One Metropolitan line station , Watford , will close due to its branch being diverted onto a new route . Two of the planned Metropolitan line stations , Watford High Street and Watford Junction , are currently served by London Overground . \n \n Stations \n \n Listed for each station are the line ( s ) serving it , local authority and the fare zone in which it is located , The London Underground uses a system of nine concentric zones for the calculation of fares between stations .

One current station , Watford on the Metropolitan line , will close as the branch that it is on will be diverted on to a new route .",

Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup , including a fear of losing identity , suspicion of its activities , aggression , and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity . Xenophobia can also be exhibited in the form of an `` uncritical exaltation of another culture '' in which a culture is ascribed `` an unreal , stereotyped and exotic quality '' . \n \n The terms xenophobia and racism are sometimes confused and used interchangeably because people who share a national origin may also belong to the same race . Due to this , xenophobia is usually distinguished by opposition to foreign culture . \n Definitions \n \n Dictionary definitions of xenophobia include : `` deep-rooted fear towards foreigners '' ( Oxford English Dictionary ; OED ) , and `` fear of the unfamiliar '' ( Webster 's ) . The word comes from the Greek words ξένος ( xenos ) , meaning `` strange '' , `` foreigner '' , and φόβος ( phobos ) , meaning `` fear '' . \n \n Africa \n \n South Africa \n \n Xenophobia in South Africa has been present in both the apartheid and post–apartheid eras . Hostility between the British and Boers exacerbated by the Second Boer War led to rebellion by poor Afrikaners who looted British-owned shops . South Africa also passed numerous acts intended to keep out Indians , such as the Immigrants Regulation Act of 1913 , which provided for the exclusion of `` undesirables '' , a group of people that included Indians . This effectively halted Indian immigration . The Township Franchise Ordinance of 1924 was intended to `` deprive Indians of municipal franchise . '' \n \n In 1994 and 1995 , gangs of armed youth destroyed the homes of foreign nationals living in Johannesburg , demanding that the police work to repatriate them to their home countries . \n In 2008 , a widely documented spate of xenophobic attacks occurred in Johannesburg .

In large parts of the world he is also , or even exclusively , known as Mr . Monopoly . He also appears in the related games Advance to Boardwalk , Free Parking , Do n't Go to Jail , Monopoly City , Monopoly Junior , and Monopoly Deal . \n \n The character first appeared on Chance and Community Chest cards in U.S. editions of Monopoly in 1936 . The identity of the artist who designed the character was long a mystery . In 2013 Wendy Wolfe , granddaughter of the artist , having read historian and author Philip Orbanes remarks that the artist was unknown , contacted Orbanes . He then obtained from the artist 's children material identifying their father as the artist and delivered a paper at the June 4 , 2013 meeting of the Association of Puzzle and Game Collectors , Meet Dan Fox – The Artist Who Created “ Mr . Monopoly ” . \n \n History \n \n The unnamed character made his first appearance outside of Monopoly within the Parker Brothers ' game Dig , released in 1940 , before the U.S. entered World War II . The character did not receive a name until 1946 when the game Rich Uncle was published by Parker Brothers . His likeness appeared on that game 's box lid , game instructions , and currency . \n \n Between 1985 and 2008 , the character appeared in the second `` O '' in the word Monopoly as part of the game 's logo . More recently , the character is depicted over the word `` Monopoly '' , drawn in a 3-D style , and extending his right hand . The character , however , no longer appears uniformly on every Monopoly game box . \n \n In 1988 , Orbanes published the first edition of his book The Monopoly Companion . In the book , all of the characters that appear on the Monopoly board or within the decks of cards received a name . Uncle Pennybags ' full name was given as Milburn Pennybags , the character `` In Jail '' is named `` Jake , the Jailbird '' , and the police officer on Go to Jail is named `` Officer Mallory '' . \n \n In 1999 , Rich Uncle Pennybags was renamed Mr . Monopoly . During the same year , a Monopoly Jr. CD-ROM game was released within cereal boxes as part of a General Mills promotion . This game introduced Mr . Monopoly 's niece and nephew , Sandy and Andy . \n \n According to the book , Monopoly : The World 's Most Famous Game & How It Got That Way and The Monopoly Companion , Mr . Monopoly has a second nephew named Randy , although the Monopoly Companion mistakenly refers to Sandy as a boy . Monopoly : The World 's Most Famous Game & How It Got That Way also states that Mr . Monopoly has a wife named Madge . He is named as the sixth richest fictional character in the 2006 Forbes Fictional 15 list on its website and the ninth richest in 2011 .",

It is also the third most topographically prominent peak in Western Europe , after Mont Blanc and Mount Etna , and is ranked 64th in the world by prominence . The peak is not exceptionally dramatic in terms of steepness or local relief . The south flank of the mountain is gentle and presents no technical challenge , as is the case for the long west ridge . The shorter , somewhat steeper north east ridge is slightly more technical . The north face of the mountain , however , is much steeper , and offers several routes involving moderately steep climbing on snow and ice ( up to French grade AD ) in the winter . \n \n Mulhacén can be climbed in a single day from the villages of either Capileira or Trevélez , but it is more common to spend a night at the mountain refuge at Poqueira , or in the bare shelter at Caldera to the west . Those making the ascent from Trevelez can also bivouac at the tarns to the northeast of the peak . \n \n Accidents \n \n On 5 March 2006 , three British climbers from Teesside died on the mountain from suspected hypothermia . Initial reports quoting the Spanish Civil Guard stated that the three were ill-equipped for the extreme conditions .

The Mott 's brand `` Rose 's '' is by far the most common brand of grenadine sold in the United States , and is formulated from ( in order of concentration ) : high fructose corn syrup , water , citric acid , sodium citrate , sodium benzoate , FD & C Red # 40 , natural and artificial flavours and FD & C Blue # 1 . \n In Europe , Bols still manufactures grenadine with pomegranate . \n \n Use in cocktails \n \n Grenadine is commonly used to mix both modern and classic cocktails , such as the Tequila Sunrise , original ( 1920s ) Sea Breeze , or La Tomate ( pastis with grenadine ) . \n \n Grenadine is also a popular ingredient in some non-alcoholic drinks , such as the Roy Rogers , pink lemonade and Shirley Temple cocktails , or simply by mixing the syrup with cold water in a glass or jug , sometimes with ice . \n \n Pomegranate syrup found in most Middle Eastern groceries is made with pomegranate concentrate and sugar , and serves as an authentic grenadine .",

The woman in the painting is shown to be beautiful with smooth complexion and big eyes . The colors have been given to enhance the beauty of the woman . The front part painted with choicest of colors merges with rough colors that reflect in the mirror to highlight the difference . \n \n Interpretations \n \n How Pablo Picasso views his beloved forms the understanding of one interpretation where her beauty is the subject . The yellow side of her face represents happy times with Picasso . The bright colors represent the times together . This side of her face shows her youth in the makeup free completion . This woman is painted with colors that increase her beauty . \n \n The reflection represents the other interpretation of how she views herself . The colors used here are dark and make her look very old . Instead of happiness the meaning here is more of hate and unhappiness , fear and as if aging is getting on to her indicative of her fear of losing her youth .",

They are most commonly canines , as with warthogs , pig , and walruses , or , in the case of elephants , elongated incisors . In most tusked species both the males and the females have tusks although the males ' are larger . Tusks are generally curved , though the narwhal 's sole tusk is straight and has a helical structure . In the elephant , the tusks were originally second incisors . Continuous growth is enabled by formative tissues in the apical openings of the roots of the teeth . \n \n Uses \n \n Tusks have a variety of uses depending on the animal . Social displays of dominance , particularly among males , are common , as is their use in defense against attackers . Elephants use their tusks as digging and boring tools . Walruses use their tusks to grip on ice and to haul out on ice . The presence of a tusk in only the male narwhals suggests that for these whales the tusk is a secondary sex characteristic . \n \n Tusks are used by humans to produce ivory , which is used in artifacts and jewellery , and formerly in other items such as piano keys . Consequently , many tusk-bearing species have been hunted commercially and several are endangered . The ivory trade has been severely restricted by the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) . \n \n In earlier times elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds ( more than 90 kg ) were not uncommon , though it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds . \n \n Gallery",

Espresso is a notoriously finicky beverage , and good manual espresso making is considered a skilled task . Further , preparation of other beverages , particularly milk-based drinks such as cappuccinos and lattes , but also non-espresso coffee such as drip or press pot , requires additional work and skill for effective frothing , pouring and most often latte art . \n \n The barista usually has been trained to operate the machine and to prepare the coffee based on the guidelines of the roaster or shop owner , while more experienced baristas may have discretion to vary preparation or experiment . \n \n To make the coffee well , there is a series of steps needing attention , including grinding the beans , extracting the coffee , frothing the milk and pouring . \n \n Beyond the preparation of espresso and other beverages and general customer service , skilled baristas acquire knowledge of the entire process of coffee to effectively prepare a desired cup of coffee , including maintenance and programming of the machine , grinding methods , roasting , and coffee plant cultivation , similar to how a sommelier is familiar with the entire process of wine making and consumption . A barista can acquire these skills by attending training classes , but they are more commonly learned on the job . \n \n Competition \n \n Formal barista competitions originated in Norway , and today the most prestigious is the World Barista Championships , held annually at varied international locations . Baristas worldwide compete , though they must first compete in a competition held in their own country to qualify to enter in the WBC . \n \n Training \n \n There are many schools providing barista training worldwide , many of which belong to the [ http : //www.scaeitalia.com/ Specialty Coffee Association of Europe ( SCAE ) ] .",

An isolated mansion of unspecified size , the house has a number of apparently unused rooms that become important to the narrative during the Bertha Mason passages . The Hall 's gloomy character also expresses and amplifies the sense of Mr. Rochester 's depression and malaise before he falls in love with Jane . \n \n In contrast , the grounds surrounding Thornfield are sublime and healthful to the novel 's many troubled characters and serve as a backdrop to many happier scenes . \n \n Inspiration \n \n It is suggested that Brontë based Thornfield on Haddon Hall , near Bakewell , Derbyshire , although the evidence for this is unclear and doubtful ; it is perhaps based on filmmakers ' use for some of the novel 's on-screen adaptations . Haddon Hall has been used to depict Thornfield on multiple occasions : for the 1996 film directed by Franco Zeffirelli , in 2006 for the BBC mini series directed by Susanna White , and for the 2011 feature starring Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender directed by Cary Fukunaga . \n \n Another theory holds that North Lees Hall in Hathersage was the inspiration for Thornfield , particularly given that `` Morton '' in the novel is believed to be based on Hathersage , and that Bronte stayed in the area before writing the novel . \n \n A third theory is that High Sunderland Hall in Halifax was the basis for Thornfield . The house had all the Gothic features of Thornfield and is a location that was familiar to the Brontë family .",

The Baltic Exchange was founded in the on Threadneedle Street in 1744 ; it is now located on St Mary Axe . \n \n Etymology \n \n Some believe that the name originated as Three Needle Street ( first attested in 1598 ) , perhaps from a signboard portraying three needles , or from the three needles on the arms of needle-makers who had premises on the street . The threads and needles used by the members of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors is another possibility , since the livery company 's hall has been located on Threadneedle Street since 1347 . Before 1598 the road was part of Broad Street ( now Old Broad Street ) . \n \n Points of interest \n \n In addition to the Bank of England , there are a number of shops , banks , restaurants and offices located on Threadneedle Street . \n \n The Merchant Taylors ' Hall , home of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors , has occupied a site off Threadneedle Street since 1347 .

The table omits the time before 2500 million years ago , which is not divided into periods . \n \n Correlation issues \n \n In a steady effort ongoing since 1974 , the International Commission on Stratigraphy has been working to correlate the world 's local stratigraphic record into one uniform planet-wide benchmarked system . \n \n American geologists have long considered the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian to be periods in their own right though the ICS now recognises them both as 'subperiods ' of the Carboniferous Period recognised by European geologists . Cases like this in China , Russia and even New Zealand with other geological eras has slowed down the uniform organization of the stratigraphic record . \n \n Notable changes \n * Changes in recent years have included the abandonment of the former Tertiary Period in favour of the Paleogene and succeeding Neogene periods . \n * The abandonment of the Quaternary period was also considered but it has been retained for continuity reasons . \n * Even earlier in the history of the science , the Tertiary was considered to be an 'era ' and its subdivisions ( Paleocene , Eocene , Oligocene , Miocene and Pliocene ) were themselves referred to as 'periods ' but they now enjoy the status of 'epochs ' within the more recently delineated Paleogene and Neogene periods .",

It is the first of the three ossicles , and attached to the tympanic membrane . The head of the malleus is the large protruding section , which attaches to the incus . The head connects to the neck of malleus , and the bone continues as the handle of malleus , which connects to the tympanic membrane . Between the neck and handle of the malleus , lateral and anterior processes emerge from the bone . \n \n The malleus is unique to mammals , and evolved from a lower jaw bone in basal amniotes called the articular , which still forms part of the jaw joint in reptiles and birds . \n \n Development \n \n Embryologically it is derived from the first pharyngeal arch along with the rest of the bones of mastication , such as the maxilla and mandible . \n \n Function \n \n The malleus is one of three ossicles in the middle ear which transmit sound from the tympanic membrane ( ear drum ) to the inner ear . The malleus receives vibrations from the tympanic membrane and transmits this to the incus . \n \n History \n \n Several sources attribute the discovery of the malleus to the anatomist and philosopher Alessandro Achillini . The first brief written description of the malleus was by Berengario da Carpi in his Commentaria super anatomia Mundini ( 1521 ) . Niccolo Massa 's Liber introductorius anatomiae described the malleus in slightly more detail and likened both it and the incus to little hammers terming them malleoli . \n \n Additional images",

The ground was situated in the centre of Scunthorpe , at the junction of Doncaster Road and Henderson Avenue . As part of the relocation deal the site was sold to the supermarket chain Safeway who constructed a store on the site . After Safeway were taken over in 2004 by Morrisons the store was subsequently sold to Sainsbury 's . The site of the centre-spot was highlighted by a plaque in front of the delicatessen counter ; however this was later removed and all that remains of the site 's former use is a plaque by the entrance to the store . \n \n Attempts to move the cantilever stand to Glanford Park proved impractical , and it was demolished along with the rest of the old stadium . \n \n Scunthorpe 's record attendance of 23,935 was set at the Old Showground on 30 January 1954 for an FA Cup 4th round tie against Portsmouth . \n \n The last player to score here was Steve Lister .",

The Independent . 9 April 1994 . Retrieved 23 March 2013 . \n \n He co-founded Dr Feelgood with Wilko Johnson in 1971 and was the band 's lead singer , harmonica player and occasional guitarist . According to one obituary : `` Brilleaux and Johnson developed a frantic act , often charismatically dressed in dark suits and loose ties , shabby rather than smart . The rough , and almost ruthless , edge which ran through his vocal and harmonica style reflected the character and philosophy of the band . '' \n \n In 1976 , Brilleaux helped found Stiff Records , one of the driving forces of the `` New Wave '' of the mid- to late-1970s , with a loan from singer-songwriter John Hiatt . \n \n Johnson left Dr Feelgood in 1977 . Brilleaux reformed the band with different musicians in the 80s and early 90s . By 1984 he was the only founder member remaining . In 1986 , he recorded the album Brilleaux 86 , featuring songs by Johnny Cash . His last performance was in January 1994 , at the Dr Feelgood Music Bar in Canvey Island . \n \n He died on 7 April 1994 of lymphoma , at the age of 41 , at his home in Leigh-on-Sea , Essex . \n \n Legacy \n \n After a one-year hiatus Dr. Feelgood appointed Pete Gage as their new vocalist . \n \n In 2011 , contemporary artist and Dr. Feelgood fan Scott King announced his intention to commemorate Lee Brilleaux by erecting a 300 ft gold-plated statue of the musician on the foreshore in Southend-on-Sea close to the legendary Kursaal where the band played some of their most important gigs . An e-petition was launched to collect signatures in support of the project , and it now has approximately 1500 signatures . \n \n In 2014 , music writer Zoë Howe announced her intention to write Roadrunner , a biography based on Brilleaux 's life , including a collection of his life stories and memories , with classic and unseen images . The book reached 100 % crowd-funding via Unbound on 18 May 2014 , and is due in 2015 . Howe is also the co-author of Looking back at me , an autobiography of Wilko Johnson , the original guitarist with Dr. Feelgood . \n The book was published , by Polygon , not Unbound , as Lee Brilleaux : Rock'n'Roll Gentleman",

It is a basidiomycete in the order Boletales . \n \n Taxonomy \n \n The species was first described under the name Boletus lacrymans by Franz Xavier von Wulfen in 1781 . It was transferred to the genus Serpula by Petter Karsten in 1884 . \n \n The specific epithet is derived from the Latin words serpula for `` creeping '' ( as in a serpent ) and lacrymans , meaning `` making tears '' . \n \n Environment \n \n Serpula lacrymans has a preference for temperatures of 21 to but can survive any temperature from 3 to . It is not clear how much light is needed to promote Serpula lacrymans growth . In terms of aeration Serpula lacrymans often grows near ventilation shafts which shows a preference for concentrated oxygen . A moisture content of 30 to 40 percent is its ideal level in wood to promote fruit body formation . It appears that Serpula lacrymans requires an environment where both inorganic and organic materials are present . The fungus uses calcium and iron ions extracted from plaster , brick , and stone to aid the breakdown of wood , which results in brown rot . \n \n Distribution \n \n Although it is a common indoor biodeterioration agent , it has only been found in a few natural environments , the Himalayas , Northern California , the Czech Republic and east Asia . A recent study on the evolutionary origin and spread of this species using genetic markers ( amplified fragment length polymorphisms , DNA sequences and microsatellites ) on a worldwide sample of specimens suggested the existence of two main lineages , a nonaggressive lineage found in North America , and an aggressive lineage found on all continents , both in natural environments and buildings . \n \n Impact on structures \n \n Serpula lacrymans is considered to be the most damaging destroyer of indoor wood construction materials in temperate regions . \n \n `` In the United Kingdom alone , money spent by building owners rectifying damage caused by dry rot was at least 150 million pounds per annum .

'' It also refers to the original three hills of Boston . \n * The Hub , which is a shortened form of a phrase recorded by writer Oliver Wendell Holmes , The Hub of the Solar System . This has since developed into The Hub of the Universe . \n * The Athens of America , which is a title given by William Tudor , co-founder of the North American Review , for Boston 's great cultural and intellectual influence . Also a nickname of Philadelphia . \n * The Puritan City , which was given in reference to the religion of the city 's founders . \n * The Cradle of Liberty , which derives from Boston 's role in instigating the American Revolution . \n * City of Notions , which was coined in the nineteenth century . \n * America 's Walking City , which was given due to Boston 's compact and high density nature , which has made walking an effective and popular mode of transit in the city . In fact , it has the seventh-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters of any city in the United States , while neighboring Cambridge is the highest . \n * Beantown , which refers to the regional dish of baked beans . According to Boston-Online.com , back in colonial days , a favorite Boston food was beans baked in molasses for several hours . Boston was part of the `` triangular trade '' in which slaves in the Caribbean grew sugar cane to be shipped to Boston , in order to be made into rum and in turn sent to West Africa for the acquisition of more slaves . Sailors and traders called it `` Beantown '' while the locals did not refer to their city by that nickname . \n * Titletown , which refers to Boston 's historic dominance in the world of sports , specifically the Boston Celtics , who have won 17 NBA Championships . \n * City of Champions , which—much like Titletown—refers to Boston 's recent streak of dominance in sports , with the Boston Red Sox , Boston Celtics , Boston Bruins , and New England Patriots each winning national championships in the last decade . This nickname is sometimes also associated with nearby Brockton . \n * The Olde Towne , which comes from the fact that Boston is one of the oldest cities in the United States . It is often used in reference to the Boston Red Sox ( The Olde Towne Team ) .",

During the filming of Tarzan , Ely did virtually all of his stunts for the series , and suffered two dozen major injuries in the process , including two broken shoulders and various lion bites .

The surface is covered by sand . \n \n A new dohyō is built prior to each tournament by the yobidashi , who are responsible for this activity . The dohyō is removed after each tournament , and in the case of Nagoya , pieces are taken home by the fans as souvenirs .

It is also worn on special occasions by Ashkenazi Jews . In western Europe this garment is called a Sargenes . The word Sargenes is related to the Old French Serge as well as Latin Serica . The term has mainly fallen out of use in modern times , except in certain neighborhoods such as Washington Heights in New York City . \n \n As a burial shroud , the kittel provides a simple attire that assures equality for all in death . Because Jewish law dictates that the dead are buried without anything else in the coffin other than simple linen clothes , a kittel has no pockets . \n \n It is also worn by married men on Yom Kippur and in some instances on Rosh Hashanah . The wearing of a kittel on the High Holidays is symbolically linked to its use as a burial shroud , and , to the verse `` our sins shall be made as white as snow '' ( ) . \n \n Many Jews also wear a kittel when leading the Passover Seder . In some communities , the cantor wears it during certain special services during the year , such as the first night of Selichot , the seventh day of the Holiday of Sukkot ( also known as Hoshanah Rabbah ) , the Musaf prayers of Shemini Atzeret and the first day of Passover , where the prayers for rain ( Tefilat HaGeshem ) and dew ( Tefilat HaTal ) are respectively recited . According to many traditions a bridegroom wears a kittel on his wedding day . \n \n The white color is said to symbolize purity , which partly explains its use during weddings . It is also felt to signify unity with the bride ( who also wears white ) and the beginning of a new life together . Another reason worn at the wedding is because it has no pockets , showing that the couple is marrying for love , not for what they possess .",

A tone is produced either by the mixture of a color with gray , or by both tinting and shading . Mixing a color with any neutral color ( including black , gray and white ) reduces the chroma , or colorfulness , while the hue remains unchanged . \n \n In common language , the term `` shade '' can be generalized to furthermore encompass any varieties of a particular color , whether technically they are shades , tints , tones , or slightly different hues ; while the term `` tint '' can be generalized to refer to any lighter or darker variation of a color ( e.g . Tinted windows ) . \n \n When mixing colored light ( additive color models ) , the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red , green and blue ( RGB ) is always white , not gray or black . When we mix colorants , such as the pigments in paint mixtures , a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma , or saturation , than the parent colors . This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black . Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness , or energy level ; in painting , lightness is adjusted through mixture with white , black or a color 's complement . \n \n It is common among some artistic painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called shades—or to lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called tints . However , this is not always the best way for representational painting , since an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in their hues . For instance , darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows , reds and oranges , to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum . Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges . Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite , or complementary , color ( e.g . violet-purple added to yellowish-green ) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue , and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color . When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color ( e.g . adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum ) .",

It consists of a round , cylindrical or a box-shaped open-topped container , made from or lined with a heatproof material and designed to hold burning charcoal . \n \n In North America , the term `` hibachi '' refers to a small cooking stove heated by charcoal ( actually called shichirin in Japanese ) , or to an iron hot plate ( teppan ) used in teppanyaki restaurants . \n \n History \n \n It is not known when the hibachi was first used in Japan . However , written records suggest that it was in use by the Heian period ( 794–1185 AD ) . Owing to the low availability of metal in Japan , early hibachis were made from dug-out cypress wood lined with clay . However , craftsmen soon began to make more decorative versions with lacquered finishes , gold leaf , and other artistic embellishments . Stronger materials such as metal and ceramics became popular over time . Traditional hibachis can be very attractive objects in themselves and are today sometimes sold as antiques . They were originally used mainly by the samurai classes and aristocrats but gradually spread among the general population . Their design developed throughout the Edo period . \n \n For most of its history the hibachi was used for heating , but it has been put to many uses ; for example , as a cigarette lighter and portable stove for Japanese troops during World War II . \n \n The hibachi was once a common sight in Japan before the Second World War , and was often seen in waiting rooms at train stations , but it became a rarity and was gradually replaced by the oil heaters now commonplace in Japan . ( Central heating is relatively rare in Japanese homes . ) Hibachis remain in use in some traditional settings , such as tea ceremony , older stores , and outdoor festivals in winter , such as setsubun . \n \n Use \n \n As with other braziers , charcoal often sits on a layer of ash . To handle the charcoal , most often a pair of metal chopsticks are used , similar to Western fire irons and tongs , called . \n \n Usage in English \n \n The traditional Japanese hibachi is a heating device and not usually used for cooking . In English , however , `` hibachi '' often refers to small cooking grills typically made of aluminium or cast iron , with the latter generally being of higher quality . Owing to their small size , hibachi grills are popular as a form of portable barbecue . They resemble traditional , Japanese , charcoal-heated cooking utensils called shichirin . It has been suggested that these grills were confusingly marketed as `` hibachi '' when they were introduced to North America because that word was easier than `` shichirin '' for English speakers to pronounce . ' \n \n Alternatively , `` hibachi-style '' is often used in the United States as a term for Japanese teppanyaki cooking , in which gas-heated hotplates are integrated into tables around which many people ( often multiple parties ) can sit and eat at once . The chef performs the cooking in front of the diners , typically with theatrical flair—such as lighting a volcano-shaped stack of raw onion hoops on fire .",

Together with enflurane and halothane , it replaced the flammable ethers used in the pioneer days of surgery . Its name comes from being a structural isomer of enflurane , hence they have the same empirical formula . It is a racemic mixture of ( R ) and ( S ) optical isomers . Its use in human medicine is now starting to decline , being replaced with sevoflurane , desflurane , and the intravenous anaesthetic propofol . Isoflurane is still frequently used for veterinary anaesthesia . \n \n Isoflurane is always administered in conjunction with air and/or pure oxygen . Often nitrous oxide is also used . Although its physical properties imply that anaesthesia can be induced more rapidly than with halothane , its pungency can irritate the respiratory system , negating this theoretical advantage conferred by its physical properties . It is usually used to maintain a state of general anesthesia that has been induced with another drug , such as thiopentone or propofol . It vaporizes readily , but is a liquid at room temperature . It is completely nonflammable . \n \n It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines , the most important medications needed in a health system . \n \n Adverse effects \n \n Animal studies have been raised safety concerns of certain general anesthetics , in particular ketamine and isoflurane in young children . The risk of neurodegeneration was increased in combination of these agents with nitrous oxide and benzodiazepines such as midazolam . Whether these concerns occur in humans is unclear . \n \n Elderly \n \n Concerns exist with regard to the relationship between administration of isoflurane and postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) , for which the elderly are especially vulnerable . \n \n Biophysical studies using state-of-the-art NMR spectroscopy has provided molecular details of how inhaled anesthetics interact with three amino acid residues ( G29 , A30 and I31 ) of amyloid beta peptide and induce aggregation . This area is important as `` some of the commonly used inhaled anesthetics may cause brain damage that accelerates the onset of Alzheimer ’ s disease '' . \n \n Physical properties \n \n Mechanism of action \n \n Similar to many general anesthetics , the exact mechanism of the action has not been clearly delineated . Isoflurane reduces pain sensitivity ( analgesia ) and relaxes muscles . Isoflurane likely binds to GABA , glutamate and glycine receptors , but has different effects on each receptor . It potentiates glycine receptor activity , which decreases motor function . It inhibits receptor activity in the NMDA glutamate receptor subtypes . Isoflurane inhibits conduction in activated potassium channels . Isoflurane also affects intracellular molecules . It activates calcium ATPase by increasing membrane fluidity . It binds to the D subunit of ATP synthase and NADH dehydrogenase . \n \n Environment \n \n The average lifetime of Isoflurane in the atmosphere is 3.2 years , its Global warming potential is 510 and the yearly emissions add up to 880 tons .",

Of the former of these records two copies were preserved in the Chapter House at Westminster Abbey ( now in The National Archives ( United Kingdom ) at Kew ) , and it has been printed by Rymer ( Foedera , ~i . 542 ) . Another copy , preserved originally in the Tower of London , is now also in The National Archives . The latter record , containing the various acts of homage and fealty extorted by Edward from Balliol and others in the course of his progress through Scotland in the summer of 1296 and in August at the parliament of Berwick , was published by Prynne from the copy in the Tower and now in The National Archives ( United Kingdom ) at Kew ( Piece reference C 47/23/3 ) . Both records were printed by the Bannatyne Club in 1834 . \n \n The derivation of the word ragman is described in several mixed and conflicting accounts . Various guesses as to its meaning and a list of examples of its use for legal instruments both in England and Scotland will be found in the preface to the Bannatyne Clubs volume , and in Jamiesons Scottish Dictionary , s.v . Ragman . Brewer 's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable defines `` Ragman Roll '' as follows : \n \n : originally meant the “ Statute of Rageman ” ( De Ragemannis ) , a legate of Scotland , who compelled all the clergy to give a true account of their benefices , that they might be taxed at Rome accordingly . Subsequently it was applied to the four great rolls of parchment recording the acts of fealty and homage done by the Scotch nobility to Edward I. in 1296 ; these four rolls consisted of thirty-five pieces sewn together . The originals perished , but a record of them is preserved in the Rolls House , Chancery Lane . \n \n The name ragman roll survives in the colloquial rigmarole , a rambling , incoherent statement . Merriam Webster gives a very different account of the origin rigmarole and the term `` Ragman Roll '' . \n \n The name of Ragman has been sometimes confined to the record of 1296 . There is an account of this given in Calendar of Documents relating to Scotland preserved in the Public Record Office , London ( 1884 ) , vol . ii. , Introd. , p. xxiv ; and as to the seals see p. lii and appendix .",

          "context": "A hematoma or haematoma is a localized collection of blood outside the blood vessels , usually in liquid form within the tissue . An ecchymosis , commonly ( although erroneously ) called a bruise , is a hematoma of the skin larger than 10mm . \n \n It is not to be confused with hemangioma , which is an abnormal buildup of blood vessels in the skin or internal organs . \n \n Presentation \n \n The word `` haematoma '' came into usage around 1850 . The word derives from the Greek roots `` heme- '' ( blood ) and -oma , from soma , meaning body a body of blood . Another etymological derivation would be from `` haemat- '' and `` -oma '' \n `` -ing '' , thus simply `` bleeding '' . \n \n Hematomas can occur within a muscle . Some hematomas form into hard masses under the surface of the skin . This is caused by the limitation of the blood to a subcutaneous or intramuscular tissue space isolated by fascial planes . This is a key anatomical feature that prevents such injuries from causing massive blood loss . In most cases the sac of blood or hematoma eventually dissolves ; however , in some cases they may continue to grow or show no change . If the sac of blood does not disappear , then it may need to be surgically removed . Hematomas can occur when heparin is given via an intramuscular route ; to avoid this , heparin must be given intravenously or subcutaneously . \n \n The slow process of reabsorption of hematomas can allow the broken down blood cells and hemoglobin pigment to move in the connective tissue . For example , a patient who injures the base of his thumb might cause a hematoma , which will slowly move all through the finger within a week . Gravity is the main determinant of this process . \n \n Hematomas on articulations can reduce mobility of a member and present roughly the same symptoms as a fracture . \n \n In most cases , movement and exercise of the affected muscle is the best way to introduce the collection back into the blood stream . \n \n A mis-diagnosis of a hematoma in the vertebra can sometimes occur ; this is correctly called a hemangioma ( buildup of cells ) or a benign tumor . \n \n Classification \n \n Types \n \n * Subdermal hematoma ( under the skin ) \n * Skull/brain : \n * * Subgaleal hematoma – between the galea aponeurosis and periosteum \n * * Cephalohematoma – between the periosteum and skull . Commonly caused by vacuum delivery and vertex delivery . \n * * Epidural hematoma – between the skull and dura mater \n * * Subdural hematoma – between the dura mater and arachnoid mater \n * * Subarachnoid hematoma – between the arachnoid mater and pia mater ( the subarachnoid space ) \n * * Othematoma – between the skin and the layers of cartilage of the ear \n * Breast hematoma ( breast ) \n * Perichondral hematoma ( ear ) \n * Perianal hematoma ( anus ) \n * Subungual hematoma ( nail ) \n \n Degrees \n \n * Petechiae – small pinpoint hematomas less than 3 mm in diameter \n * Purpura ( purple ) – a bruise about 1 cm in diameter , generally round in shape \n * Ecchymosis – subcutaneous extravasation of blood in a thin layer under the skin , i.e . bruising or `` black and blue , '' over 1 cm in diameter",

It is similar to ( and sometimes indistinguishable from ) a hematoma , commonly called a bruise , though the terms are not interchangeable in careful usage . Specifically , bruises are caused by trauma whereas ecchymoses , which are the same as the spots of purpura except larger , are not necessarily caused by trauma , often being caused by pathophysiologic cell function . \n \n A broader definition of ecchymosis is the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels . The term also applies to the subcutaneous discoloration resulting from seepage of blood within the contused tissue . \n \n Signs and symptoms \n \n Hematomas can be subdivided by size . By definition , ecchymoses are 1 centimeter in size or larger , and are therefore larger than petechiae ( less than 2 millimeters in diameter ) or purpura ( 2 millimeters to 1 centimeter in diameter ) . Ecchymoses also have a more diffuse border than other purpura . \n \n Cause \n \n There are many causes of subcutaneous hematomas including ecchymoses . Coagulopathies such as Hemophilia A may cause ecchymosis formation in children . \n \n Etymology and pronunciation \n \n The word ecchymosis ( ; plural ecchymoses , ) comes to English from New Latin , based on Greek ekchymōsis , from ekchymousthai `` to extravasate blood '' , from ex- ( elided to e- ) and chymos , `` juice '' .

          "context": "Chemistry is often called the central science because of its role in connecting the physical sciences , which include chemistry , with the life sciences and applied sciences such as medicine and engineering . The nature of this relationship is one of the main topics in the philosophy of chemistry and in scientometrics . The phrase was popularized by its use in a textbook by Theodore L. Brown and H. Eugene LeMay , titled Chemistry : The Central Science , which was first published in 1977 , with a thirteenth edition published in 2014 . \n \n The central role of chemistry can be seen in the systematic and hierarchical classification of the sciences by Auguste Comte in which each discipline provides a more general framework for the area it precedes ( mathematics → astronomy → physics → chemistry → physiology and medicine → social sciences ) . Balaban and Klein have more recently proposed a diagram showing partial ordering of sciences in which chemistry may be argued is “ the central science ” since it provides a significant degree of branching . In forming these connections the lower field can not be fully reduced to the higher ones . It is recognized that the lower fields possess emergent ideas and concepts that do not exist in the higher fields of science . \n \n Thus chemistry is built on an understanding of laws of physics that govern particles such as atoms , protons , electrons , thermodynamics , etc . although it has been shown that it has not been “ fully 'reduced ' to quantum mechanics ” . Concepts such as the periodicity of the elements and chemical bonds in chemistry are emergent in that they are more than the underlying forces that are defined by physics . \n \n In the same way , biology can not be fully reduced to chemistry despite the fact that the machinery that is responsible for life is composed of molecules . For instance , the machinery of evolution may be described in terms of chemistry by the understanding that it is a mutation in the order of genetic base pairs in the DNA of an organism . However , chemistry can not fully describe the process since it does not contain concepts such as natural selection that are responsible for driving evolution . Chemistry is fundamental to biology since it provides a methodology for studying and understanding the molecules that compose cells . \n \n Connections made by chemistry are formed through various sub-disciplines that utilize concepts from multiple scientific disciplines . Chemistry and physics are both needed in the areas of physical chemistry , nuclear chemistry , and theoretical chemistry . Chemistry and biology intersect in the areas of biochemistry , medicinal chemistry , molecular biology , chemical biology , molecular genetics , and immunochemistry . Chemistry and the earth sciences intersect in areas like geochemistry and hydrology .",

The literal meaning of sic bo is `` precious dice '' , while dai siu and dai sai mean `` big [ or ] small '' . \n \n Sic bo is a casino game , popular in Asia and widely played ( as dai siu ) in casinos in Macau . It is played in the Philippines as hi-lo . It was introduced to the United States by Chinese immigrants in the early 20th century , and can now be found in most American casinos . Since 13 May 2002 , it can be played legally in licensed casinos in the United Kingdom , under The Gaming Clubs ( Bankers ' Games ) ( Amendment ) Regulations 2002 ( Statutory Instrument 2002/1130 ) . \n \n Gameplay involves betting that a certain condition ( e.g . that all three dice will roll the same ) will be satisfied by a roll of the dice . \n \n Gameplay \n \n Players place their bets on certain areas of the table as shown in the picture above .

( It is distinct from Hazard , another gambling game of Old English origin , played with two dice . ) The dice are either thrown with a cup or rolled down a chute containing a series of inclined planes ( `` hazard chute '' ) that tumble the dice as they fall . Threes-of-a-kind are known as `` raffles '' and pay out at 180 to 1 . \n \n Chuck-a-luck , also known as `` sweat cloth '' , `` chuckerluck '' and birdcage , The Official World Encyclopaedia of Sports and Games 1979 Diagram Group p 128 is a variant in the United States , which has its origins in grand hazard . The three dice are kept in a device that resembles a wire-frame bird cage and that pivots about its centre . The dealer rotates the cage end over end , with the dice landing on the bottom . Chuck-a-luck usually features only the single-number wagers , sometimes with an additional wager for any `` triple '' ( all three dice showing the same number ) with odds of 30 to 1 ( or thereabouts ) . Chuck-a-luck was once common in Nevada casinos but is now rare , frequently having been replaced by sic bo tables .",

Therefore , the social environment is a broader concept than that of social class or social circle . \n \n Solidarity \n \n People with the same social environment often develop a sense of social solidarity ; they often tend to trust and help one another , and to congregate in social groups .

A second venue was opened in Cardiff in 2001 and others followed . \n \n In May 2016 , the Columbo Group purchased the Barfly from its previous owner , MAMA & Company .

The venue was initially housed in one `` pod '' of the building but this was closed down sometime in 2002 , moving to what was the Zero Club ( now The Plug ) on Matilda Street . The Barfly vacated these premises soon afterwards , and left Sheffield altogether . \n \n On 2 June 2008 , the Brighton The Barfly ( formerly the Gloucester Nightclub ) closed down without notice . \n \n Cambridge Barfly opened in 2007 after the Barfly chain took over The Graduate public house .

The sanctuary ( temenos ) grew up around his burial mound ( tumulus ) , located in the Classical period at the feet of Apollo 's statue . The literary myths serve to link him to local cults , and to identify him with Apollo . \n \n Mythology \n \n In Greek mythology , Hyakinthos was given various parentage , providing local links , as the son of Clio and Pierus , King of Macedon , or of king Oebalos of Sparta , or of king Amyclas of Sparta , progenitor of the people of Amyclae , dwellers about Sparta . His cult at Amyclae , where his tomb was located , at the feet of Apollo 's statue , dates from the Mycenaean era . \n \n In the literary myth , Hyakinthos was a beautiful youth and lover of the god Apollo , though he was also admired by the West Wind , Zephyros . Apollo and Hyakinthos took turns throwing the discus . Hyakinthos ran to catch it to impress Apollo , was struck by the discus as it fell to the ground , and died . A twist in the tale makes the wind god Zephyros responsible for the death of Hyakinthos . His beauty caused a feud between the two gods . Jealous that Hyakinthos preferred the radiant archery god Apollo , Zephyros blew Apollo 's discus off course , so as to injure and kill Hyakinthos . When he died , Apollo did not allow Hades to claim the youth ; rather , he made a flower , the hyacinth , from his spilled blood . According to Ovid 's account , the tears of Apollo stained the newly formed flower 's petals with the sign of his grief . The flower of the mythological Hyacinth has been identified with a number of plants other than the true hyacinth , such as the iris . According to a local Spartan version of the myth , Hyacinth and his sister Polyboea were taken to Elysium by Aphrodite , Athena and Artemis . \n \n Thamyris is said by Pseudo-Apollodorus of Athens to have been a lover of Hyakinthos and thus to have been the first man to have loved another male . \n \n Hyakinthos was the tutelary deity of one of the principal Spartan festivals , the Hyacinthia , held every summer . The festival lasted three days , one day of mourning for the death of the divine hero Hyakinthos , and the last two celebrating his rebirth as Apollo Hyakinthios , though the division of honours is a subject for scholarly controversy . \n \n Interpretation \n \n The name of Hyakinthos is of pre-Hellenic origin , as indicated by the suffix -nth . According to classical interpretations , his myth , where Apollo is a Dorian god , is a classical metaphor of the death and rebirth of nature , much as in the myth of Adonis . It has likewise been suggested that Hyakinthos was a pre-Hellenic divinity supplanted by Apollo through the `` accident '' of his death , to whom he remains associated in the epithet of Apollon Hyakinthios .",

They also considered the study of theology as a species of idolatry , and regarded learned men who did any preaching as falsifiers of God 's word . \n \n Nicholas Storch led this sect , preaching that the teaching of the Holy Spirit was all that was necessary . \n Andreas Karlstadt adopted these views , abandoned his title of doctor and became a street porter . \n \n Doubts of Accuracy \n \n Early Anabaptists were viewed disdainfully by their adversaries as a radical peasant movement . Thus some consider the extant descriptions to be an elitist caricature of either a particular Anabaptist group or Anabaptists as a whole . Most more recent reference works have ceased to mention the group at all . No equivalent entry was present in the New Catholic Encyclopedia .

Suya is generally made with skewered beef , ram , or chicken . Innards such as kidney , liver and tripe are also used . The thinly sliced meat is marinated in various spices which include peanut cake , salt , vegetable oil and other flavorings , and then barbecued . Suya is served with further helpings of dried pepper mixed with spices and sliced onions . Halal meat preparation methods are normally used , especially in the northern parts of Nigeria , where the suspicion of nonconformity to Muslim dietary prohibitions in Suya preparation has been known to cause riots . A dried version of Suya is called Kilishi . It can be taken with Garri or Ogi . \n \n There is no standard recipe for the production of the complex mixture of spices and additives which make up the Suya marinade ( called Yaji ) and the spice mix served with it .

Suya has become a Nigerian national dish with different regions claiming the superiority of their recipe and methods of preparation , but similar grilled meat recipes are common in many West African countries . \n \n Suya is a mass consumer fast food , called a street food because preparation and sales are often done in small stalls along local streets , sometimes under dubious hygienic conditions . Concerns have been raised about the hygienic standards of processing and safety of roadside Suya . Suya is normally sold wrapped in old newspaper which has been criticized for serving as a possible source of contamination . Tapeworm ( Taenia saginata ) from infested beef has been found to survive the temperatures used in preparing Suya and remain viable to infect humans . Cases of Haemolytic anaemia have been described after ingestion of Suya , possibly as a result of adulteration of food additives .",

It is a protein-rich food that is a staple in Nigeria . Some adaptations also put apples in MoiMoi . It originated from West Africa . \n \n Procedure for preparing moimoi \n \n MoiMoi is prepared by first soaking the beans in cold water until they are soft enough to remove the fine outer covering or peel . Then they are ground or blended ( using a blender ) until a fine paste is achieved . Salt , bouillon cube , dried crayfish , vegetable oil ( or any edible oil such as palm oil ) and other seasonings are added to taste . Some add sardines , corned beef , sliced boiled eggs , or a combination of these and other 'garnishes ' to liven up MoiMoi . Such is referred to as having ' x ' number of lives , ' x ' representing the number of garnishes added . The most touted is MoiMoi elemi meje , which translates to Moi Moi with 7 lives . \n \n Moi Moi usually comes in a slanted pyramid shape or a cylindrical shape , owing to the mold it is poured into prior to cooking . The pyramid shape comes from the traditional broad `` ewe eran '' ( Thaumatococcus daniellii ) or banana leaves fashioned into a cone in one 's palm , then the seasoned and garnished liquid is poured into the leaves , which is then folded . \n \n The cylindrical shapes come from empty cans of milk or tomato sauce used in preparation of other dishes . Once placed in its mold , it is placed in a large pot about a tenth filled with water . The water is the source of steam that cooks the MoiMoi . MoiMoi is eaten alone or with bread as a snack , with rice as a meal or with ogi for breakfast or supper . it can also be taken with garri in the afternoon . \n \n File : Moin Moin.jpg|Sliced moin moin \n File : Moimoi.JPG| '' Ewe eran '' leaves ( Thaumatococcus daniellii )",

Other common names include pink shrimp , deepwater prawn , deep-sea prawn , great northern prawn , ' and northern shrimp . \n \n Distribution \n \n P. borealis lives at depths of 20 - , usually on soft muddy bottoms , in waters with a temperature of 0 - . The distribution of the nominate subspecies P. b. borealis in the Atlantic ranges from New England , Canada 's eastern seaboard ( off Newfoundland and Labrador and eastern Baffin Island in Nunavut ) , southern and eastern Greenland , Iceland , Svalbard , Norway and the North Sea as far south as the English Channel . In the Pacific , P. b. eous is found from Japan , through the Sea of Okhotsk , across the Bering Strait , and as far south in North America as Washington state . \n \n Physiology \n \n In their 8-year lifespan , males can reach a length of 120 mm , while females can reach 165 mm long . \n \n The shrimp are hermaphroditic . They start out male , but after a year or two , their testicles turn to ovaries and they complete their lives as females . \n \n Commercial fishing \n \n P. borealis is an important food resource , and has been widely fished since the early 1900s in Norway , and later in other countries following Johan Hjort 's practical discoveries of how to locate them . In Canada , these shrimp are sold peeled , cooked and frozen in bags in supermarkets , and are consumed as appetizers . \n \n Northern shrimp have a short life , which contributes to a variable stock on a yearly basis . However , the species is not considered overfished due to a large amount reported and a large amount harvested . \n \n In Canada , the annual harvest limit is set to 164,000 tonnes ( 2008 ) . The Canadian fishery began in the 1980s and expanded in 1990s . \n \n In 2013 the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission determined that stocks of P. borealis were too low and shut down the New England fishery . This was the first cancellation in 35 years . \n \n Uses \n \n Beyond human consumption , shrimp alkaline phosphatase ( SAP ) , an enzyme used in molecular biology , is obtained from Pandalus borealis , and the species ' carapace is a source of chitosan , a versatile chemical used for such different applications as treating bleeding wounds , filtering wine or improving the soil in organic farming .",

Professional skateboarders Karl Watson , Shuriken Shannon , Tuukka Korhonen , and Sean Malto have been recognized for their ability to perform the nollie trick . A nollie can be easily confused with a fakie ollie , whereby the rider uses his/her original foot position but is instead riding backwards ( `` fakie '' is the skateboard term for riding in a backwards direction , the opposite of your usual stance , sometimes referred to as `` switch '' ) . \n \n Description \n \n A nollie is a variation of the ollie , where the skateboarder uses the front foot to push the nose of the skateboard down and the back foot is slid in a backwards direction to achieve lift-off from the ground ; this is the opposite of an ollie , whereby the rider uses the back foot to push down the tail and the front foot to slide forwards . It is similar to a switch ollie riding backwards and Malto has stated in an instructional video : `` It 's more a like a switch ollie , but from the front . '' \n \n Execution \n \n The forward rolling motion that is required for the execution of a nollie can make it easier to push the nose of the skateboard down towards the ground than when executing an ollie . \n \n Variations \n \n Like ollies , a nollie can be combined with other tricks to form variations . For example , a nollie can be combined with a kickflip to create a nollie flip , or a nollie can be combined with a 360-flip to create a nollie 360-flip . \n \n Nollie 180 \n \n A nollie whereby the skateboarder and the skateboard rotate 180-degrees after leaving the ground . Both the skateboarder and the skateboard rotate in the same direction , and frontside and backside variations can be performed . After landing the trick , the skateboarder will be facing in the opposite direction . \n \n Nollie heelflip \n \n A heelflip that is executed at the front of the board , whereby the heel of the back foot executes the flip . Professional skateboarder , Josiah Gatlyn , has stated that the variation is `` basically , just like a backward switch heel [ flip ] '' . \n \n Helipop \n \n Also known as a 'nollie backside 360 ' ( not caballerial , caballerial is fakie ) , this is a nollie variation whereby the skateboarder and the skateboard rotate 360-degrees after leaving the ground . The trick was invented by Rodney Mullen and can be seen in the Almost : Round Three video during the section when Mullen is skateboarding on the Hollywood Stars in Los Angeles , California , United States ( US ) . \n \n Nollie bigspin heelflip \n \n Notable nollies \n \n Professional skateboarder , Danny Way , executed a nollie down the famous Carlsbad Gap ( no longer in existence ) , located in California , United States ( US ) . The location was notorious for its degree of difficulty due to the upward angle of the landing area .",

It has several racetracks varying from 1,000 to 4,000 metres in length with 46 different starting posts . The course is home to more than half of the group one races held in France , and has a capacity of 50,000 . The highlight of the calendar is the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe . Held on the first weekend in October , the prestigious event attracts the best horses from around the world . \n \n The first-ever race run at Longchamp was on Sunday , April 27 , 1857 in front of a massive crowd . The Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Eugénie were present , having sailed down the Seine River on their private yacht to watch the third race . Until 1930 , many Parisians came to the track down the river on steamboats and various other vessels , the trip taking around an hour to the Pont de Suresnes . The royal couple joined Prince Jérôme Bonaparte and his son Prince Napoleon in the Royal Enclosure alongside the Prince of Nassau , Prince Murat and the Duke of Morny , an avid racegoer . Non-aristocratic members of the upper classes were not permitted into the Royal enclosure and had to be content with watching from their barouche carriages on the lawn . \n \n A number of prominent artists have painted horse racing scenes at Longchamp including the one seen here by Édouard Manet in 1867 and another four years later by Edgar Degas titled Race Horses at Longchamp . \n \n Racing continued during the German occupation of France in World War II , with many German officers in the stands . \n \n The bonus DVD on the re-release of the U2 album , The Joshua Tree features a concert from the Joshua Tree Tour filmed at Longchamp .",

It is often referred by Hershey as `` The Great American Chocolate Bar . '' The Hershey Milk Chocolate Bar was first sold in 1900 followed by the Hershey 's Milk Chocolate with Almonds variety beginning production in 1908 . A circular version of the milk chocolate bar called Hershey 's Drops was released in 2010 . \n \n Hershey 's milk chocolate \n \n The Hershey Process milk chocolate used in these bars uses fresh milk delivered directly from local farms . The process was developed by Milton Hershey and was the first mass-produced chocolate in the United States . As a result , the Hershey flavor is widely recognised in the United States , but less so internationally , in particular in areas where European chocolates are more widely available . The process is a trade secret , but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed , producing butyric acid , which stabilises the milk from further fermentation . This flavour gives the product a particular sour , `` tangy '' taste , to which the US public has come to associate with the taste of chocolate , to the point that other manufacturers often add butyric acid to their milk chocolates , however people not accustomed to the flavour , often those not from the US tasting the chocolate , frequently associate this additional flavour as being that of vomit . The American bar 's taste profile was not as popular with the Canadian public , leading Hershey to introduce a reformulated Canadian bar in 1983 . \n \n Other varieties and details \n \n In addition to the standard Milk Chocolate and Milk Chocolate with Almonds varieties Hershey 's also produces several other chocolate bars in various flavors : Special Dark chocolate , Cookies 'N ' Creme , Symphony ( both Milk Chocolate and Almond Toffee ) , Mr. Goodbar ( with peanuts ) , and Krackel ( with crisped rice ) . There were also nine limited flavors : Double Chocolate , Nut Lovers , Twosomes Reese 's Pieces , Cookies 'N ' Chocolate , Cookies 'N ' Mint , Strawberries 'n ' Creme , Raspberries 'n ' Creme , Twosomes Heath , and Twosomes Whoppers . All flavors have between 210 and 230 calories per standard-sized bar . \n \n All flavors are approved by the Kashruth Division of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America for consumption by observant Jews , with OU Kosher status . \n \n The largest Hershey 's bar commercially available weighs 5 lb and costs US $ 44.99 on Hershey 's website .",

The Dreadnought style has since been copied by other guitar manufacturers and is now a common style of guitar body . \n \n The dreadnought guitar body is larger than most other guitars that existed at the time of its creation , and thus results in a bolder and often louder tone . In 1916 the word 'dreadnought ' referred to a large , all big-gun modern battleship of the type inaugurated by in 1906 . The distinctive marks of a Dreadnought guitar are square shoulders and bottom . The neck is usually attached to the body at the 14th fret . This is called `` having 14 frets clear of the body '' in luthier 's terminology . \n \n Martin Dreadnought guitars are also known as `` D-size '' guitars , or , colloquially among musicians , as `` dreads . '' Martin Dreadnought guitars have model numbers consisting of `` D- '' followed by a number , such as `` D-18 '' and `` D-45 . '' \n \n History \n \n The Dreadnought style was originally developed in 1916 and was manufactured by Martin specifically for retailer the Oliver Ditson Company . In 1931 , Martin began producing Dreadnought guitars carrying the Martin name . The first two models were the D-1 and D-2 , with bodies made of mahogany and rosewood respectively . \n \n The popularity of and demand for Martin Dreadnought guitars was increased by their use , almost exclusively , by folk musicians of the mid-20th century , including most bluegrass guitarists . Today they are considered the standard guitar of bluegrass music , used by many bluegrass musicians to produce a signature sound of that genre . \n \n Martin Dreadnoughts manufactured prior to 1946 are extremely desired by musicians due to their loud volume and exceptional tone due to the use of scalloped bracing . It is not uncommon for these guitars to sell for in excess of $ 30,000 . \n \n The Gibson Guitar Company introduced its first dreadnought guitar , the Hummingbird , in 1960 ; it has since become the guitar of choice for many country-western singers , though Gibson 's initial response to the Martin Dreadnought was the Jumbo , which it introduced in 1934 . \n \n Since then , dreadnoughts have been made by nearly all of the major guitar manufacturers worldwide in both standard and more recently various single cutaway forms .",

The ribs run across the fabric from selvage to selvage . \n \n Poplin is now made with wool , cotton , silk , rayon , polyester or a mixture of these .

Shirts made from this material are easy to iron and do not wrinkle easily . \n \n Poplins are used for dress purposes , and for rich upholstery work which are formed by using coarse filling yarns in a plain weave . \n \n The term poplin originates from papelino , a fabric made at Avignon , France , in the 15th century , named for the papal ( pope 's ) residence there , and from the French papelaine a fabric , normally made with silk , of the same period .

Eventually , however , the term came to denote the highest status of Roman city . \n \n It is also the origin of the modern term colony . \n \n Characteristics \n \n The Roman Republic , having no standing army , used to plant bodies of their own citizens in conquered towns as a kind of garrison . Initially these bodies would consist partly of Roman citizens , usually to the number of three hundred ; but after Augustus the number was increased and thousands of Romans who retired from their legions were granted lands in many colonies in the empire . \n \n In the first century of the Roman Empire the colonies were made only of `` veterans '' and were responsible for the Romanization of many territories ( mainly in the spread of Latin language and of Roman laws & customs ) . Nowadays neo-Latin languages are spoken in many of the areas where these veterans settled . \n \n After the era of the Severian emperors the new `` colonies '' were only cities that were granted a status ( often of tax exemption ) and in most cases during the Late Imperial times there was no more settlement of retired legionaries . \n \n History \n \n According to Livy , Rome 's first colonies were established in about 752 BC at Antemnae and Crustumerium . \n \n Other early colonies were established at Signia in the 6th century BC , Velitrae and Norba in the 5th century BC , and Ostia , Antium , and Tarracina in the late 4th century . In this first period of colonization , which lasted down to the end of the Punic Wars , colonies were primarily military in purpose , being intended to defend Roman territory . There were colonies of citizens and colonies of Latins , which differed in size , constitution , and region . Colonies of citizens were typically coastal and known as coloniae maritimae . These were small ( three hundred families ) , close to Rome , and enjoyed no civic life of their own . Sherwin-White suggested that they were similar to the Athenian cleruchy . \n \n Coloniae also included towns founded by Rome to house those who held Roman citizenship . In Britain this usually meant those who had completed their military service in the Legions and were thus owed a grant of land by the state ; see Marian Reforms . \n \n Examples \n \n Some examples are ( origins of modern names suggested in bold ) :",

He served in the household of Henry II 's brother William X , Count of Poitou . \n \n William I of England gave a mansion in the eastern end of the parish of Great Stamford Bridge in Essex and another in Sanford in Somerset to a Norman named Auvrai Le Breton for his services in the Battle of Hastings in 1066 .

However , since in no month does the average monthly precipitation falls below 60 mm in Victoria , the city does not have a true dry season month . This lack of a true dry season month is a primary reason why the climate falls under the tropical rainforest climate category . The capital averages about 2,000 mm of precipitation annually .

          "context": "In the philosophy of science , there are several definitions of protoscience . Its simplest meaning ( most closely reflecting its roots of proto- + science ) involves the earliest eras of the history of science , when the scientific method was embryonic . Thus , in the late 17th century and early 18th century , Isaac Newton contributed to the dawning sciences of chemistry and physics even though he was also an alchemist who sought chrysopoeia in various ways , some of which were unscientific . Our era views his as one of protoscience . Another meaning extends this idea into the present , involving the distinction between hard and soft sciences , in which various sciences ( or branches thereof ) are ranked according to methodological rigor . In this sense , the physical sciences may be posited as science whereas psychoanalysis may be labeled as protoscience because not all of its theoretical foundation is based on empirical evidence . Protoscience in this sense is sometimes distinguished from pseudoscience by a genuine willingness to be changed through new evidence , as opposed to having theory that can always find a way to rationalize a predetermined belief . Compare fringe science , which is considered highly speculative or even strongly refuted . Some protosciences go on to become an accepted part of mainstream science. , newsletter Center for Frontier Sciences , Temple University ( 1990 ) . Archived from [ http : //www2.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/truzzi.html the original ] in April 19 , 2012 . \n \n Philosopher of chemistry Jaap Brakel defines protoscience as `` the study of normative criteria for the use of experimental technology in science . '' \n Thomas Kuhn said that protosciences `` generate testable conclusions but ... nevertheless resemble philosophy and the arts rather than the established sciences in their developmental patterns . I think , for example , of fields like chemistry and electricity before the mid-18th century , of the study of heredity and phylogeny before the mid-nineteenth , or of many of the social sciences today . '' While noting that they meet the demarcation criteria of falsifiability from Popper , he questions whether the discussion in protoscience fields `` result [ s ] in clear-cut progress '' . Kuhn concluded that protoscience , `` like the arts and philosophy , lack some element which , in the mature sciences , permits the more obvious forms of progress . It is not , however , anything that a methodological prescription can provide . ... I claim no therapy to assist the transformation of a proto-science to a science , nor do I suppose anything of this sort is to be had '' . \n \n The term prescientific means at root `` relating to an era before science existed '' . For example , traditional medicine existed for thousands of years before medical science did , and thus many aspects of it can be described as prescientific . In a related but somewhat different sense , protoscientific topics ( such as the alchemy of Newton 's day ) can be called prescientific , in which case the proto- and pre- labels can function more or less synonymously ( the latter focusing more sharply on the idea that nothing but science is science ) .",

It is often related to tubal pregnancies and is a procedure that is preferred over its ovarian tube-sparing counterparts due to the high rate of recurrence in said ectopic pregnancies . \n \n Salpingectomy is different from a salpingostomy and salpingotomy . The latter two terms are often used interchangeably and refer to creating an opening into the tube ( e.g . to remove an ectopic pregnancy ) , but the tube itself is not removed . Technically , the creation of a new tubal opening ( os ) by surgery would be a salpingostomy , while the incision into the tube to remove an ectopic is a salpingotomy . \n \n Indications \n \n The procedure was performed by Lawson Tait in 1883 in patients with a bleeding ectopic pregnancy ; this procedure has since saved the lives of countless women . Other indications for a salpingectomy include infected tubes , ( as in a hydrosalpinx ) or as part of the surgical procedure for tubal cancer . \n \n A bilateral salpingectomy will lead to sterility , and was used for that purpose , however less invasive procedures have become available as tubal occlusion procedures . \n \n Process \n \n Salpingectomy has traditionally been done via a laparotomy ; more recently however , laparoscopic salpingectomies have become more common as part of minimally invasive surgery . The tube is severed at the point where it enters the uterus and along its mesenteric edge with hemostatic control . \n \n Salpingo-oophorectomy \n \n Salpingectomy is commonly done as part of a procedure called a salpingo-oophorectomy , where one or both ovaries , as well as one or both Fallopian tubes , are removed in one operation ( a Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy ( BSO ) if both ovaries and Fallopian tubes are removed ) . If a BSO is combined with a hysterectomy , the procedure is commonly called a TAH-BSO : Total Abdominal Hysterectomy with a Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy . Sexual intercourse remains possible after salpingectomy , surgical and radiological cancer treatments , and chemotherapy . Reconstructive surgery remains an option for women who have experienced benign and malignant conditions . \n \n History \n \n Salpingectomies were performed in the United States in the early 20th century in accordance with eugenics legislation . From Buck v. Bell ( 1927 ) : \n \n The Virginia statute providing for the sexual sterilization of inmates of institutions supported by the State who shall be found to be afflicted with an hereditary form of insanity or imbecility , is within the power of the State under the Fourteenth Amendment .

They may worry about seeing others naked , being seen naked , or both . Their fear may stem from a general anxiety about sexuality , from a fear that they are physically inferior , or from a fear that their nakedness leaves them exposed and unprotected . \n \n Gymnophobia should not be confused with avoidance or shunning of many forms of nudity on modesty or other rational or moral grounds . Many people avoid public nudity as well as nudity in private situations , and some have an aversion to nudity as an aspect of prudishness or body shame . \n \n Gymnophobia refers to an actual fear of nudity , but most sufferers with the condition learn how to function in general society despite the condition . They may , for example , avoid changing rooms , washrooms , showers , and beaches . However , the condition can be regarded as an anxiety disorder if the person can not control the phobia or it is interfering with their daily life . Gymnophobia is common among children , especially those undergoing puberty . Child gymnophobia is common due to peer pressure , bullying , and a fear of exposing sexual organs . \n \n Gymnophobia has been likened to the fictional condition `` never-nude '' portrayed in the comedy series Arrested Development .",

Pre-Columbian in origin . \n \n History \n \n Pre-Columbian in origin , the sandals are believed related to the cactle or cactli , of Náhuatl origin . The name `` Huarache '' is derived from the Purépecha language term kwarachi , and directly translates into English as sandal . \n \n Early forms have been found in and traced to the countryside farming communities of Jalisco , Michoacan , Guanajuato and Yucatan . Originally of all-leather construction , the thong structure around the main foot is still traditionally made with hand-woven braided leather straps . \n \n After originating in the peasant communities , they were adopted by some religious orders , such as the Franciscan friars . In the 1930s , wider variations began to appear , with soles derived from used rubber car tires—hence the modern `` tread '' form of sole . After the Second World War , veterans started to travel deeper into Mexico ; they gained popularity in North America thanks to their adoption as part of the 1960s hippie lifestyle . By the end of the 20th century they were to be found all over North and South America . \n \n Styles \n \n Traditional huarache designs vary greatly , but are always very simple . Originally made of all-leather , later early designs included woven string soles and occasionally thin wooden soles . Later more elaborate upper designs were created by saddlers and leather workers . \n \n The modern huarache developed from the adoption in the 1930s of rubber soles developed from used rubber car-tires . Modern designs vary in style from a simplistic sandal to a more complex shoe , using both traditional leather as well as more modern synthetic materials . \n \n Many shoes claim to be huaraches , but they are still traditionally only considered a huarache if they are handmade , and have a woven-leather form in the upper . \n \n Media \n \n Huaraches are mentioned in the lyrics of the Beach Boys songs `` Surfin ' U.S.A. '' and `` Noble Surfer '' ; and in the novel Ask the Dust , written by John Fante ( the Camilla Lopez 's shoes ) also in the novel On the Road , written by Jack Kerouac . Skeeter Phelan wears a pair of the shoes , which her traditionalist Southern mother hates , in the Kathryn Stockett novel The Help . Doc Sportello , the detective from Thomas Pynchon 's Inherent Vice , wears a pair of huaraches . He eventually loses one shoe and finishes the adventure using only the other one .",

However , some opposition parties boycotted it , claiming unfair conditions .

          "context": "Demand-pull Inflation is asserted to arise when aggregate demand in an economy outpaces aggregate supply . It involves inflation rising as real gross domestic product rises and unemployment falls , as the economy moves along the Phillips curve . This is commonly described as `` too much money chasing too few goods '' . More accurately , it should be described as involving `` too much money spent chasing too few goods '' , since only money that is spent on goods and services can cause inflation . This would not be expected to happen , unless the economy is already at a full employment level . \n \n The term demand-pull inflation is mostly associated with Keynesian economics . \n \n How it happens \n \n In Keynesian theory , increased employment results in increased aggregate demand ( AD ) , which leads to further hiring by firms to increase output . Due to capacity constraints , this increase in output will eventually become so small that the price of the good will rise . \n At first , unemployment will go down , shifting AD1 to AD2 , which increases demand ( noted as `` Y '' ) by ( Y2 - Y1 ) . This increase in demand means more workers are needed , and then AD will be shifted from AD2 to AD3 , but this time much less is produced than in the previous shift , but the price level has risen from P2 to P3 , a much higher increase in price than in the previous shift . \n This increase in price is called inflation . \n \n Demand-pull inflation is in contrast with cost-push inflation , when price and wage increases are being transmitted from one sector to another . \n However , these can be considered as different aspects of an overall inflationary process : demand-pull inflation explains how price inflation starts , and cost-push inflation demonstrates why inflation once begun is so difficult to stop . \n \n Causes of Demand-Pull Inflation \n \n * There is a quick increase in consumption and investment along with an extremely confident firms . \n * There is a sudden increase in exports which might lead to a huge under-valuation of the currency . \n * There is a lot of government spending . \n * The expectation that inflation will rise often leads to a rise in inflation . Workers and firms will increase their prices to 'catch up ' to inflation . \n * There is excessive monetary growth - when there is too much money in the system chasing too few goods . The 'price ' of a good will thus increase .",

It consists of one or more layers of epithelial cells overlying a layer of loose connective tissue . It is of ectodermal origin and is continuous with the skin at various body openings such as the eyes , ears , nose and mouth , the urethral opening and the anus .

It consists of an epithelium ( one or more layers of epithelial cells ) and an underlying lamina propria of loose connective tissue . Mucosae line various cavities of the body that are either externally exposed to the environment or are internal organs , and the mucous membranes ensure that the underlying lamina propria of connective tissue remains moist . They are at several places contiguous with skin : at the nostrils , the lips of the mouth , the eyelids , the ears , the trachea , the stomach , the genital area , and the anus . \n \n In the female , the glans clitoridis and the clitoral hood have mucous membranes . In the male , the glans penis ( the head of the penis ) and the inner layer of the foreskin have mucous membranes .

Mucous membranes are rather delicate ; they are able to absorb a number of substances and toxins but are vulnerable regarding pain . If the lining is torn or broken , mucus is incapable of performing its roles of preventing infection and retaining tissue moisture levels . Some mucous membranes are involved with digestion in the absorption of insoluble food molecules and secretion ( releasing chemicals from glands ) . The thick fluid secreted by some mucous membranes and/or associated glands is termed mucus . The mucus can be protective .",

At the time , it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Cossus , Ambustus , Cossus and Potitus ( or , less frequently , year 348 Ab urbe condita ) . The denomination 406 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period , when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years . \n \n Events \n \n By place \n \n Greece \n \n * Callicratidas is appointed as the navarch of the Spartan fleet , replacing Lysander . Callicratidas assembles a fleet and sails to Methymna , on Lesbos , to which he lays siege . This move threatens the Athenian grain supply . \n * Alcibiades is replaced by a board of generals . Athens sends a member of the board , Admiral Conon , to relieve the siege of Mytilene . To defend Lesbos , Conon is forced to move his numerically inferior fleet from Samos to the Hekatonnesi islands near Methymna . When Callicratidas attacks him , Conon is forced back to Mytilene , where he is blockaded by Callicratidas ' Spartan fleet . \n * Athens wins the Battle of Arginusae , near Lesbos , and the blockade of Conon is broken . To relieve Conon , the Athenians assemble a new fleet composed largely of newly constructed ships manned by inexperienced crews . This inexperienced fleet is inferior to the Spartans , but its commanders employ new and unorthodox tactics , which allow the Athenians to secure a dramatic and unexpected victory . The Spartan force is soundly defeated , and Callicratidas is killed . \n * Returning to Athens after the battle , Theramenes leads Athenian agitation against the eight generals who have commanded in the engagement ; the six who have returned to Athens are condemned for negligence in not having picked up survivors from the ships disabled in the battle . The Athenian generals ( including Pericles ' son ) are put to death . \n * Sparta sues for peace , which the Athenian leader Cleophon rejects .

It was published on 28 November 1939 . \n \n This book is set in and around Hamford Water in Essex , close to the resort town of Walton-on-the-Naze . It brings the Swallows and the Amazons together and introduces a new group of characters , the Eels and the Mastodon . Ransome used to sail to Hamford Water , an area of tidal salt marshes and low-lying islands , in his yacht Nancy Blackett . He set the book here to offer his characters new opportunities to explore and make maps in a different landscape . \n \n Plot summary \n \n The Swallows intend to sail in the Goblin to Hamford Water and camp with their father , but he is called away on naval business . Instead he maroons them with a small dinghy on an island . Before he leaves , Father gives them an outline map of the area they decide to call Secret Water and suggests they survey and chart the area before he returns to pick them up . For the first time , their small sister Bridget accompanies them on this adventure . \n For a surprise , Father has arranged for the Amazons to come down from the Lake District and join them with another dinghy . \n \n They see some mysterious footprints which they think look as though they were made by a Mastodon , but turn out to have been left by a local boy wearing mudshoes . He mistakes them for the Eels , another family who camp in the area regularly . Later the Eels arrive and are initially hostile before they settle down for a friendly war , culminating with feast of the Sacred Eel , complete with `` human sacrifice '' . The `` sacrifice '' is Bridget , who very nearly does not arrive at her party , as a result of being trapped in the middle of a ford by a rising tide with Titty and Roger . The danger is genuine , since high tide level would have been well above their heads . They are rescued by the Mastodon in the nick of time . \n \n It seems that due to the distractions of war and being cut off by the tides , the chart will not be completed . However early in the last morning two separate groups of children complete it .",

          "context": "17th-century philosophy in the Western world is generally regarded as being the start of modern philosophy , and a departure from the medieval approach , especially Scholasticism . \n \n Early 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Reason or Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed the Renaissance philosophy era and precede the Age of Enlightenment . \n \n Europe \n \n In the West , 17th-century philosophy is usually taken to start with the work of René Descartes , who set much of the agenda as well as much of the methodology for those who came after him . The period is typified in Europe by the great system-builders — philosophers who present unified systems of epistemology , metaphysics , logic , and ethics , and often politics and the physical sciences too . \n Immanuel Kant classified his predecessors into two schools : the rationalists and the empiricists , and Early Modern Philosophy ( as 17th- and 18th-century philosophy is known ) is sometimes characterized in terms of a supposed conflict between these schools . The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been René Descartes , Baruch Spinoza , and Gottfried Leibniz . Building upon their English predecessor Francis Bacon , the two main empiricists of the 17th-century were Thomas Hobbes and John Locke . The former were distinguished by the belief that , in principle ( though not in practice ) , all knowledge can be gained by the power of our reason alone ; the latter rejected this , believing that all knowledge has to come through the senses , from experience . Thus the rationalists took mathematics as their model for knowledge , and the empiricists took the physical sciences . \n This emphasis on epistemology is at the root of Kant 's distinction ; looking at the various philosophers in terms of their metaphysical , moral , or linguistic theories , they divide up very differently . Even sticking to epistemology , though , the distinction is shaky : for example , most of the rationalists accepted that in practice we had to rely on the sciences for knowledge of the external world , and many of them were involved in scientific research ; the empiricists , on the other hand , generally accepted that a priori knowledge was possible in the fields of mathematics and logic . \n \n This period also saw the birth of some of the classics of political thought , especially Thomas Hobbes ' Leviathan , and John Locke 's Two Treatises of Government . \n \n List of 17th-century philosophers \n \n * Francisco Suárez ( 1548–1617 ) \n * Francis Bacon ( 1561–1626 ) \n * Mir Damad ( d. 1631 ) \n * Galileo Galilei ( 1564–1642 ) \n * Mulla Sadra ( 1571–1640 ) \n * Hugo Grotius ( 1583 -1645 ) \n * Thomas Hobbes ( 1588–1679 ) \n * Pierre Gassendi ( 1592–1655 ) \n * René Descartes ( 1596–1650 ) \n * Thomas Browne ( 1605–82 ) \n * John Milton ( 1608–1674 ) \n * Blaise Pascal ( 1623–1662 ) \n * John Locke ( 1632–1704 ) \n * Baruch Spinoza ( 1632–1677 ) \n * Nicolas Malebranche ( 1638–1715 ) \n * Isaac Newton ( 1642–1727 ) \n * Gottfried Leibniz ( 1646–1716 ) \n * Pierre Bayle ( 1647–1706 ) \n * Damaris Cudworth Masham ( 1659–1708 ) \n * Mary Astell ( 1666–1731 )",

In later years the competitors did not carry backpacks , and the rifles were small bore rifles , similar to those in biathlon . The patrol leader did not have any kind of weapon . \n \n Military patrol formed part of the International Military Sports Council ( Conseil International du Sport Militaire , or CISM ) skiing championships starting in 1929 . It was in the official programme of the Winter Olympic Games in 1924 Chamonix , and on three occasions as a demonstration sport ( 1928 , 1936 and 1948 ) .

Following Brabham 's retirement as a driver at the end of the 1970 season , Tauranac owned and managed the Brabham team until 1972 , when he sold it to Bernie Ecclestone . He remained in England to assist with a redesign of a Politoys Formula One chassis for Frank Williams in 1973 and helped Trojan develop a Formula One version of their Formula 5000 car . \n \n After a brief retirement in Australia , Tauranac returned to England to establish the Ralt marque ( a name he and his brother Austin had used for some 'specials ' in Australia in the 1950s , winning the NSW Hillclimb Championship in 1954 with the Ralt 500 ) . The first `` modern '' Ralt was the Ralt RT1 chassis , to be raced in Formula Three , Formula Two and Formula Atlantic . The chassis proved successful , winning the European Formula Three championship in 1975 in the hands of Australian driver Larry Perkins . The 1978 season also proved successful for the RT1 chassis , winning the European F3 championship for Jan Lammers . \n \n Tauranac designed the Theodore Racing F1 car for the 1978 season . Two new designs were created for the 1979 season : the RT2 for Formula Two and the RT3 for Formula Three . The RT3 chassis won the 1983 European F3 championship for Pierluigi Martini and five consecutive British F3 titles . A joint venture with Honda resulted in the RH6 chassis , which won the 1981 , 1984 and 1985 titles . In October 1988 , Tauranac sold the Ralt business to March Engineering for £1.25 million . \n \n Tauranac has remained involved with various aspects of the sport since departing from Ralt , including racing-school cars for Honda , a Formula Renault car , consulting work for the Arrows Formula One team , and continuing his relationship with Honda that goes back to their early Formula Two days as engine supplier to Brabham in the 1960s . He has moved back to Australia but retains an interest in the sport . Tauranac can be seen each year as a design judge at the Formula SAE Australasia competition in Melbourne , Australia .",

Ronnie Dawson of Ireland , Keith Rowlands of Wales , Bob Stuart and Dick Littlejohn of New Zealand and the Australians Nick Shehadie and Ross Turnbull approved of the choice of the trophy . The trophy is being cared for and restored after each game by silversmiths Thomas Lyte . \n \n It was soon named `` The Webb Ellis Cup '' .

The Webb Ellis Cup has been held by four nations ; New Zealand , Australia , South Africa and England . \n \n The current holders are New Zealand after beating Australia 34–17 in the 2015 Final in England .

In 1933 he emigrated to Jerusalem in Mandate Palestine . He was granted Palestinian citizenship in 1936 and changed his name to Mordecai Ardon . \n \n He participated in the Venice Biennale of 1968 . \n \n Beginning in the 1950s Ardon adopted a complex system of symbolic images in his paintings , taken from the Jewish Mystical tradition ( Kabbalah ) , from the Bible and from a tangible reality . In his painting `` Gates of Light '' , for example , he expressed `` the inner mystery and timelessness of the landscape . '' His work seeks to impart a cosmic dimension to the present , linking it to antiquity and mystery . The same approach can be found in `` At the Gates of Jerusalem '' ( 1967 ) , which shows the attempt to `` convey his feelings about the cosmic significance of Israel ’ s return to the Old City of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War '' . `` Bird near a yellow wall '' ( 1950 ) demonstrates his simplistic involvement with the Holocaust , a subject to which he was one of the few Israeli artists to devote a phase of his work , at that time . \n \n As a teacher and director of the `` New Bezalel '' , Ardon conveyed his sense of social involvement , his tendency towards Jewish mysticism and local mythology , and the combination of personal national symbols with reality-always stressing masterful technique . Pupils such as Avigdor Arikha , Yehuda Bacon , Naftali Bezem , Shraga Weil and Shmuel Boneh absorbed these influences and integrated them into their later work . \n \n Ardon was seen as the father of the regional approach in Israeli art . \n \n One of his most famous creations are the `` Ardon Windows '' ( 1980–1984 ) , a set of large stained-glass windows displayed prominently in the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem , incorporating visual elements from the Kabbalah . \n \n Ardon died in Jerusalem in 1992 . \n \n In 2006 his painting `` The Woodpecker of Time '' ( 1963 ) was sold at Christie 's for $ 643,200 . \n \n Education \n \n * 1920-25 Bauhaus School , Weimar , Germany , with Itten , Klee , Kandinsky , Feininger \n * 1926 Studied with Max Doerner \n \n Teaching \n \n * 1929 Kunstschule Itten , Berlin \n * 1935 Seminar , Bet Hakerem , Jerusalem \n * 1935-52 Bezalel , Jerusalem \n * 1940-52 Bezalel , Jerusalem , Director \n * 1952-63 Ministry of Education and Culture , Jerusalem , Supervisor and Art Advisor \n \n Awards and prizes \n \n * 1954 Unesco Prize \n * 1963 , Ardon was awarded the Israel Prize , in painting . \n * 1974 , he received the Yakir Yerushalayim ( Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem ) award .

She signed the manifesto Refus global , a watershed event in the Quebec cultural scene , in 1948 . \n \n In 1953 , she moved to Paris , where she worked for 13 years in drawing and painting and was introduced to the art of stained glass , for which she would become best known . \n \n One of her stained-glass windows is at Champ-de-Mars metro station in Montreal . It was one of the first non-figurative works to be installed in the metro , in defiance of the didactic style present in other works of the period , and signalled a major shift in public art in Montreal between the policies of then art director Robert Lapalme and future art director and fellow automatiste Jean-Paul Mousseau . Other examples of her works can be seen at Vendôme metro station , Hôpital Sainte-Justine , and the ICAO headquarters , in Montreal ; the Place du Portage in Gatineau , Quebec ; and the Granby , Quebec courthouse . \n \n In 1983 , she was awarded the Paul-Émile-Borduas medal for the visual arts by the government of Quebec . In 1985 , she was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec and was promoted to Grand Officer in 2000 . She was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts . \n \n She died in Montreal .",

          "context": "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog is a collection of short prose stories written by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas , first published by Dent on 4 April 1940 . The first paperback copy appeared in 1948 , published by the British Publishers Guild . \n \n Background \n \n All of the stories are autobiographical and all are set in the writer 's native Swansea in South Wales . Written over a number of years , the often comic stories show glimpses of his life , from early childhood up to his teens as a young reporter for the South Wales Daily Post . \n \n Thomas claimed , in a letter to Vernon Watkins , that he had `` kept the flippant title for—as the publishers advise—money-making reasons '' . He claimed also , somewhat dubiously , that the title was not a parody of James Joyce 's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , although the general influence of Joyce 's Dubliners was freely acknowledged . In August 1939 Thomas wrote to Watkins : `` I 've been busy over stories , pot-boiling stories for a book , semi-autobiographical , to be finished by Christmas . '' \n \n Reception \n \n Reviews of the book were mixed and initially it did not sell well . Ferris , reviewing the book in The Times Literary Supplement said : `` the atmosphere of schoolboy smut and practical jokes and poetry is evoked with lingering accuracy but with nothing more '' . Critic Jacob Korg later commented that `` taken as a group , [ the stories ] seem to trace the child 's emergence from his domain of imagination and secret pleasures into an adult world where he observes suffering , pathos , and dignity '' . \n \n The book has been described as showing Thomas ' `` waggish humor at its best , his exuberance & verbal magic in spectacular display '' . Apart from Under Milk Wood , the book is `` probably the most famous Dylan Thomas book published during his lifetime ... certainly the most loved by Dylan enthusiasts '' . It has been suggested that few writers `` have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood , of young love with its shattered dreams ... none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases , with an elation as natural and contagious '' . \n \n Adaptations \n \n The title was used for a theatrical journey through Thomas ' prose writings which was staged by Clwyd Theatr Cymru in April 2014 . \n \n Contents \n \n * `` The Peaches '' \n * `` A Visit to Grandpa 's '' \n * `` Patricia , Edith and Arnold '' \n * `` The Fight '' \n * `` Extraordinary Little Cough '' \n * `` Just Like Little Dogs '' \n * `` Where Tawe Flows '' \n * `` Who Do You Wish Was with Us ? '' \n * `` Old Garbo '' \n * `` One Warm Saturday ''",

Two decades later the sport debuted in competition at the Barcelona 1992 games where 4 events were held , with singles and doubles events for both men and women . Four medals were awarded in each event , including two bronzes . The next Olympics , Atlanta 1996 , had 5 events with the addition of mixed doubles . There was also now a playoff between the two semifinal losers to determine the sole winner of the bronze medal . This format has continued to 2016 . \n \n Events \n \n ( d ) = demonstration event \n \n Medal table \n \n Qualification \n \n The Badminton World Federation 's ranking list is used to determine qualification for the Olympic tournament . For singles , 29 competitors are selected . For doubles , 19 pairs are selected . \n \n The general method of selection is by ranking , though the selection process stops once all qualification positions are filled . All players or pairs from the top 16 places on that list qualify , though each National Olympic Committee can send a maximum of three players/pairs . Players and pairs through the 64th place on that ranking qualify , with the caveat that each NOC can send only two players/pairs from that portion of the list . Players and pairs ranked below that only qualify if they are the highest ranked competitor from their nation . \n \n In addition , one place in each of the singles events is awarded by the Tripartite Commission . There are also regulations on minimum representation . Each continent must have at least one player/pair . This is the highest ranked player/pair from that continent if none have qualified through the standard selection process . The host nation , if it has not already qualified two competitors , receives two slots as well , either two singles players or one pair . \n \n Competition \n \n Olympic badminton consists of a single-elimination tournament . Each match is played to the best of three games . Games are to 21 points . Rally scoring is used , meaning a player does not need to be serving to score . A player must win by two points or be the first player to 30 points . \n \n Participating nations \n \n The following nations have taken part in the badminton competition . The numbers in the table indicate the number of competitors sent to that year 's Olympics .",

          "context": "Word play or wordplay ( also : play-on-words ) is a literary technique and a form of wit in which the words that are used become the main subject of the work , primarily for the purpose of intended effect or amusement . Examples of word play include puns , phonetic mix-ups such as spoonerisms , obscure words and meanings , clever rhetorical excursions , oddly formed sentences , double entendres , and telling character names ( such as in the play The Importance of Being Earnest , Ernest being a given name that sounds exactly like the adjective earnest ) . \n \n Word play is quite common in oral cultures as a method of reinforcing meaning . Examples of text-based ( orthographic ) word play are found in languages with or without alphabet-based scripts ; for example , see homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese . \n \n Techniques \n \n Some techniques often used in word play include interpreting idioms literally and creating contradictions and redundancies , as in Tom Swifties : \n `` Hurry up and get to the back of the ship , '' Tom said sternly . \n \n Linguistic fossils and set phrases are often manipulated for word play , as in Wellerisms : \n `` We 'll have to rehearse that , '' said the undertaker as the coffin fell out of the car . \n Another use of fossils is in using antonyms of unpaired words – `` I was well-coiffed and sheveled , '' ( back-formation from `` disheveled '' ) . \n \n Examples \n \n Most writers engage in word play to some extent , but certain writers are particularly committed to , or adept at , word play as a major feature of their work . Shakespeare 's `` quibbles '' have made him a noted punster . Similarly , P.G . Wodehouse was hailed by The Times as a `` comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce '' for his own acclaimed wordplay . James Joyce , author of Ulysses and Finnegans Wake , is another noted word-player . For example , Joyce 's phrase `` they were yung and easily freudened '' clearly implies the more conventional `` they were young and easily frightened '' ; however , the former also makes an apt pun on the names of two famous psychoanalysts , Jung and Freud . \n \n An epitaph , probably unassigned to any grave , demonstrates use in rhyme . \n Here lie the bones of one 'Bun ' \n He was killed with a gun . \n His name was not 'Bun ' but 'Wood ' \n But 'Wood ' would not rhyme with gun \n But 'Bun ' would . \n \n Crossword puzzles often employ wordplay to challenge solvers . Cryptic crosswords especially are based on elaborate systems of wordplay . \n \n Related phenomena \n \n Word play can enter common usage as neologisms . \n \n Word play is closely related to word games ; that is , games in which the point is manipulating words . See also language game for a linguist 's variation . \n \n Word play can cause problems for translators : e.g . in the book Winnie-the-Pooh a character mistakes the word `` issue '' for the noise of a sneeze , a resemblance which disappears when the word `` issue '' is translated into another language .",

He was apprenticed as a compositor with the Morpeth Leader and worked for several country newspapers . In 1871 , he married Sarah Belford and they had five sons and one daughter . In 1873 , he moved to Sydney . In 1880 , he founded The Bulletin with Archibald , and in 18 months built its circulation in up to 15,000 . He believed in serious provocative journalism , especially exposure articles . As the result of one article , he was sued by the owner of the Clontarf pleasure gardens . He refused to pay the costs of the resulting libel action and was imprisoned for six weeks in 1882 ( the public raised £3,000 and he was released ) . \n \n In 1887 , Haynes stood for Mudgee , as a supporter of the Free Trade Party , led by Henry Parkes , which tended to be associated with Protestants . During the campaign , he repudiated his Roman Catholic faith , which led to lasting bitterness with Protectionists . He was elected and held Mudgee to 1894 . \n \n In 1891 , Haynes was ratepayer on several Sydney addresses that were the focus of radical and even anarchist activity in Sydney ( Leigh House , Active Service Brigade HQ and William McNamara 's Book Depot ) . He married his second wife , Mary Duff , in 1892 and was elected as member for Wellington in 1894 . He continued to support free trade and decentralisation . He was an unruly member of Parliament and his constant accusation of corruption involved him in bitter arguments and physical aggression , including an attack on the Protectionist member William Patrick Crick in 1893 . He married his third wife , Esther Campbell , in 1899 and they had one daughter and one son . In 1904 , he was narrowly defeated for Wellington , and continued to lose elections until elected to Willoughby in 1915 , but he was defeated in 1917 . \n \n Haynes continued to pursue the allegedly corrupt politicians Crick and William Nicholas Willis through the courts , the latter all the way to South Africa . The 1906 Royal Commission on Lands Administration partly supported his allegations . He was later editor of the Newsletter , which in 1906 attacked John Norton , fellow parliamentarian and Truth publisher , as a criminal and murderer . \n \n Death \n \n Haynes died at his residence at Alfred Street , North Sydney from heart failure supervening Influenza . He was buried on 17 August 1917 in the Presbyterian section of Rookwood Cemetery . \n \n Notes",

The concentration of converging conduction tracts near the coronary sinus results in considerable automaticity activity originating in that area . \n \n Function \n \n The normal cardiac rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node , which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava .

It was painted in 1905 when Picasso was 24 years old , during his Rose Period , soon after he settled in the Montmartre section of Paris , France . The oil on canvas painting depicts a Parisian boy holding a pipe in his left hand and wearing a garland or wreath of flowers . \n \n The painting \n \n Preparation \n \n Early preparations of this work involved positioning the boy in all types of poses that involved standing , sitting or leaning against the wall . After much repositioning of the model , Picasso decided to go with the boy sitting down . Next was how to position the arm , where much time was also spent on the height and angle . Early works do not show any objects other than a pipe being used . \n \n Although Picasso started to paint this picture , he gave it a rest period for about a month . During this time , Picasso decided to finish it off by placing a garland of flowers on the boy 's head . \n \n The boy \n \n Le Bateau-Lavoir in Montmartre is where Picasso was living when he painted the picture . Some of the local people made a living in the entertainment industry , such as being clowns or acrobats . Picasso used many local people in his pictures , but little is known about the boy in the picture . \n \n What appears to be fact from comments made from a variety of sources is that the boy was a model in his teen years who hung around Picasso 's studio and volunteered to pose for the oil work .

As a young man , he began writing fanciful articles for Parisian newspapers and vaudevilles , in a vivacious boulevardier spirit which brought him to the forefront . About 1860 , he met Ludovic Halévy , and their collaboration for the stage lasted twenty years . \n \n Their most famous collaboration is the libretto for Georges Bizet 's Carmen . However , Meilhac 's work is most closely tied to the music of Jacques Offenbach , for whom he wrote over a dozen librettos , most of them together with Halévy . The most successful collaborations with Offenbach are La belle Hélène ( 1864 ) , Barbe-bleue ( 1866 ) , La vie parisienne ( 1866 ) , La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein ( 1867 ) , and La Périchole ( 1868 ) . Also Froufrou ( 1869 ) , with Halévy . \n \n Other librettos by Meilhac include Jules Massenet 's Manon ( with Philippe Gille ) ( 1884 ) , Hervé 's Mam'zelle Nitouche ( 1883 ) , and Rip , the French version of Robert Planquette 's operetta Rip Van Winkle ( also with Gille ) . Their vaudeville play Le réveillon was the basis of the operetta Die Fledermaus . \n \n In 1888 he was elected to the Académie française . He died in Paris in 1897 .",

          "context": "In color theory , a tint is the mixture of a color with white , which increases lightness , and a shade is the mixture of a color with black , which reduces lightness . A tone is produced either by the mixture of a color with gray , or by both tinting and shading . Mixing a color with any neutral color ( including black , gray and white ) reduces the chroma , or colorfulness , while the hue remains unchanged . \n \n In common language , the term `` shade '' can be generalized to furthermore encompass any varieties of a particular color , whether technically they are shades , tints , tones , or slightly different hues ; while the term `` tint '' can be generalized to refer to any lighter or darker variation of a color ( e.g . Tinted windows ) . \n \n When mixing colored light ( additive color models ) , the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red , green and blue ( RGB ) is always white , not gray or black . When we mix colorants , such as the pigments in paint mixtures , a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma , or saturation , than the parent colors . This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black . Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness , or energy level ; in painting , lightness is adjusted through mixture with white , black or a color 's complement . \n \n It is common among some artistic painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called shades—or to lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called tints . However , this is not always the best way for representational painting , since an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in their hues . For instance , darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows , reds and oranges , to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum . Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges . Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite , or complementary , color ( e.g . violet-purple added to yellowish-green ) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue , and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color . When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color ( e.g . adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum ) .",

          "context": "The caber toss is a traditional Scottish athletic event in which competitors toss a large tapered pole called a `` caber '' . It is normally practised at the Scottish Highland Games . In Scotland the caber is usually made from a Larch tree and is typically 19 ft tall and weighs 175 lb . The term `` caber '' derives from the Gaelic word `` cabar '' or `` kaber '' which refers to a wooden beam . \n \n The person tossing the caber is called a `` tosser '' or a `` thrower '' . \n \n It is said to have developed from the need to toss logs across narrow chasms ( in order to cross them ) or by lumberjacks challenging each other to a small contest . \n \n Objective and technique \n \n The primary objective is to toss the caber so that it turns end over end , falling away from the tosser . Ideally it should fall directly away from the tosser in the `` 12 o'clock '' position . The distance thrown is unimportant . \n \n The tosser balances the caber upright , tapered end downwards , against his or her shoulder and neck ; the caber being supported by stewards or fellow-competitors while being placed into position . The tosser then crouches , sliding his interlocked hands down the caber and under the rounded base , and lifts it in his cupped hands . On standing he must balance the caber upright - no easy feat with the heavier end at the top , and less-experienced tossers may be unable to stop the caber falling to one side after lifting it . The tosser then walks or runs a few paces forward to gain momentum , and flips the tapered end upwards so that the large end hits the ground first and - if well tossed - the caber falls directly away from the tosser . \n \n In competition , tossers are normally allowed three attempts each at tossing the caber . \n \n Weight and strength are clearly essential for success , but technique is also important for balancing the caber when lifting it , and flipping up the held ( tapered ) end to promote a clean toss . \n \n Scoring \n \n The straightest end-over-end toss scores highest . If the caber lands on its end but falls back towards the thrower , the score is lower than for any end-over-end throw but is based upon the maximum vertical angle that the caber achieved ( side-judging may involve a second judge ) . \n \n Photo gallery \n \n File : Cabers_05Bel_001.jpg|A selection of cabers of various lengths and weights \n File : Caber Toss.jpg|Getting ready to lift \n File : Caber toss-2004 highland games.jpg|The run-up \n File : Caber_05SV_001.jpg|Moment of release \n File : Caber_05PNW_001.jpg|The caber in mid-flight \n File : Caber_05Tac_001.jpg|The caber strikes the ground \n File : Highland games caber toss 2.JPG|",

The park and botanical garden are open daily . \n \n The estate was begun in the late 17th century by Clelia Durazzo Grimaldi , who established the Giardino botanico Clelia Durazzo Grimaldi at that time . Today 's remarkable park was created by her nephew Ignazio Alessandro Pallavicini after he inherited the property . \n \n The park was designed by Michele Canzio , set designer for the Teatro Carlo Felice , and built between 1840 and 1846 . It covers some 97,000 m² of hillside behind the villa . Although recognizably in the English romantic style , the garden is highly theatric , to the point of being organized as a series of scenes forming a play with prologue and three acts ( Return to Nature , Memory , Purification ) . Structures and statues through the garden form focal points to this libretto . \n \n When the park opened in September 1846 , on the occasion of the VIII Congresso degli Scienziati Italiani , it quickly gained national fame . In 1928 its current owner , Matilde Gustinani , donated both park and botanical garden to Genoa for use as a public park . Through the remainder of the 20th century , the garden fell into some disrepair , and indeed was threatened in 1972 by construction of a nearby highway . Its restoration began in 1991 , however , in honor of Columbus ' discovery of America . As of 2006 about half of the park is open for visitors . \n \n The park contains two ponds , a dozen notable structures , various statues , and an extensive grotto . The grotto represents a Dantesque Inferno , with walkways and subterranean lake through which the visitor may ascend to Paradise . In former years , visitors could explore the grotto by boat . Structures include a Coffee House in the shape of triumphal arch , Rustic House , Madonna 's Chapel , Mausoleum of the Captain , Temple of Diana , Flower House , Turkish Temple , Obelisk , and Chinese Pagoda . \n \n The park also contains a number of plantings of botanical interest , including mature specimens of Araucaria bidwilli , Cedrus libani , Cinnamomum camphora , Jubaea chilensis , Notelaea excelsa , Firmiana simplex , Quercus suber , Podocarpus macrophillus , lots of extotic palms and a wonderful stand of some 160 Camellia japonica . \n \n Image : Villa durazzo pallavicini.jpg|Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini \n Image : Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini - Chinese pagoda.JPG|Chinese pagoda \n Image : Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini - Flower house.JPG|Flower house \n Image : Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini - obelisk.JPG|Obelisk \n Image : Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini - Roman bridge.JPG|Roman bridge \n Image : Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini - Temple of Diana.JPG|Temple of Diana \n Image : Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini - Bust of Michele Canzio.JPG|Bust of Michele Canzio",

          "context": "`` All I Need to Know '' is a song by British singer-songwriter , Emma Bunton . It was released as the second and final single from her third solo album , Life in Mono ( 2006 ) . The song was co-written with Jamie Hartman , who is notable for previously writing the hit `` All Time Love '' for Will Young . First announced by her official site , the single was released physically on 12 February 2007 in the United Kingdom and Ireland . It was also available to download from 5 February 2007 . The physical release of this single is a two-track CD , with a remix being available only as an iTunes exclusive . The single entered the UK Singles Chart in the week of 24 February 2007 at number 60 and charted for only one week before falling out , making it the lowest charting single of Bunton 's career at the time . \n \n Critical reception \n \n The song received mixed to positive reviews . \n \n Music OMH called the song `` similarly arresting '' , describing it as `` a beautifully tender piano ballad that the likes of Lucie Silvas would be well advised to take note of . Fraser McAlpine of TheChartBlog ( BBC ) explained the composition thus : `` the first verse is wafty and piano-led , then there 's a quiet chorus , then the drums kick in for a meatier version of same '' , while adding `` the dragging pace and out-dated 'classy ' production are going to get really boring , really quickly '' and comparing it negatively to Viva Forever . The Guardian deemed it `` breathtakingly lovely '' . \n \n Music video \n \n Directed by Max & Dania , the music video was shot shortly before Christmas 2006 in the East End of London . The video features Bunton as an angel watching over various lonely people , none of whom can see her . \n \n The only trace of her presence are floating feathers that come from her wings , which are only observable as reflections or from a distance . \n \n The video was originally inspired by the photography of Peter Lindbergh , who is one of the world 's preeminent fashion photographers . \n \n Track listings and formats \n \n These are the formats and track listings of major single releases of `` All I Need to Know '' . \n \n UK CD \n # `` All I Need to Know '' - 3:36 \n # `` Midnight and Martinis '' - 4:14 \n \n UK iTunes \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 3:36 \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 6:53 \n # `` Midnight and Martinis '' – 4:14 \n \n UK radio promo \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 3:36 \n \n UK club promo \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 6:53 \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 6:39 \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 7:15 \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 3:24 \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 3:36 \n \n 19 Management internal CD-R1 \n # `` All I Need to Know '' – 3:29 \n \n 1 \n \n Charts",

She is also the only woman in the United Kingdom to have won it and also the first person to win a million or more on a British television game show . She also has appeared on the BBC Two quiz show Eggheads since 2003 . \n \n Personal life \n \n Keppel 's father Walter Arnold Crispian Keppel ( 1914–1996 ) was a Lieutenant Commander in the Fleet Air Arm , who moved with the family to various naval postings around Britain until they settled in London when she was 17 . She took A-levels at St Mary 's School , Wantage , and completed a secretarial course , and married her first husband Desmond Corcoran , an art dealer . The couple went on to have three children , Sibylla , Alexander , and Rosie , but divorced in 1980 . In 1985 she married comedy script writer Neil Shand . They separated in 1987 . \n \n Keppel is the granddaughter of Walter , 9th Earl of Albemarle . Her great-grandfather , the 8th Earl , was brother-in-law of Alice Keppel , the mistress of King Edward VII , and was the great-uncle of Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall . The Duchess of Cornwall is therefore her second cousin once removed . Through the noble lineage of her aforementioned grandfather , her genealogy can be traced back to Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II of England , who , coincidentally , were the subjects of her Million Pound Question on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? . \n \n Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? \n \n Keppel appeared on the 20 November 2000 episode of the UK edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? , becoming the 12th winner in the world and the first in the UK to win one million pounds . At the time , she was a garden designer living in Fulham with severe monetary issues . Nonetheless , she had spent about 100 pounds phoning the quiz show more than 50 times to secure a place . `` BT rang me up and said , 'Do you realise your telephone bills are rising ? ' . '' There was speculation at the time that the win was leaked to the press so that ITV would draw ratings away from BBC One which was showing the last episode of One Foot in the Grave in the same timeslot . However , the Independent Television Commission cleared Celador and ITV of the allegations . \n \n Keppel now appears on the BBC Two quiz show Eggheads , where she and four other quiz champions are pitted against members of the public .",

Hill ( June 27 , 1859 – June 5 , 1916 ) was an American songwriter and musicologist , who composed the melody for `` Good Morning to All '' , later used as the melody for `` Happy Birthday to You '' . \n \n Biography \n \n Mildred J. Hill , born in Louisville , Kentucky , was the oldest of three sisters , Mildred , Patty , and Jessica . She learned music from her father , Calvin Cody , and Adolph Weidig . \n \n It has been reported that Mildred Hill was a kindergarten and Sunday-school teacher , like her younger sister Patty . Prof. Robert Brauneis , after extensively researching the Hill family , has concluded that she was not a kindergarten teacher . She moved into music , teaching , composing , performing , and specializing in the study of Negro spirituals . Hill and her sister were honored at the Chicago World 's Fair for their work in the progressive education program at the experimental kindergarten , the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School . \n \n She wrote about music using the pen name Johann Tonsor , and her 1892 article `` Negro Music '' , suggesting that the existing body of black music would be the basis of a distinctive American musical style , influenced Dvořák in composing the New World Symphony . \n \n Hill died in Chicago , Illinois , in 1916 , long before her song became famous . She is buried with her sister in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville , Kentucky . \n \n Mildred Hill 's manuscripts and papers are held by the University of Louisville Music Library in Louisville , Kentucky . \n \n `` Happy Birthday to You '' \n \n While teaching at the Louisville Experimental Kindergarten School , the Hill sisters wrote the song `` Good Morning to All '' ; Mildred wrote the melody , and Patty the lyrics . The song was first published in 1893 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten as a greeting song for teachers to sing to their students . \n \n `` Happy Birthday to You '' first appeared in print in 1912 using the melody of `` Good Morning to All '' with different lyrics . Its popularity continued to grow through the 1930s , with no author identified for the new lyrics , nor credit given for the melody from `` Good Morning to You '' . Based on 1935 copyright registrations by the Summy Company , and a series of court cases ( which all settled out of court ) , the sisters became known as the authors of `` Happy Birthday to You '' . The Hill Foundation today shares royalties on public performances of the song . However this was brought into question after a judge ruled against the legitimacy of the copyright . \n \n Legacy \n \n Hill and her sister were posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 12 , 1996 .",

          "context": "In American football , a nickelback is a cornerback or safety who serves as the fifth ( in addition to the typical four ) defensive back on the defense . A base defense contains four defensive backs , consisting of two cornerbacks , and two safeties . Adding an extra back makes five , hence the term `` nickel '' , which is the name for 5-cent coins in the United States and Canada . Usually the nickelback will take the place of a linebacker , so if the team were to be in a 4–3 formation , there would now be four linemen , only two linebackers and five defensive backs creating a 4-2-5 formation . However , some teams will replace a lineman rather than a linebacker , creating a three linemen , three linebacker and five defensive back alignment , a 3–3–5 formation . If an offensive team always uses three or more wide receivers , a defense may turn to a nickel defense for their base package on most plays . Usually extra defensive backs , such as a nickelback , are substituted into the defense in situations where the opposing offense is likely to attempt a forward pass , such as 3rd-and-long , or when extra receivers are substituted into the opposing offense . \n \n The nickelback is the third cornerback or safety on the depth chart . The nickelback is not considered a starting position because the starting formation for a defense has only two cornerbacks and two safeties . Defensive formations with three or more cornerbacks ( or three safeties ) are used often enough that a nickelback will usually see moderate playing time ( particularly in the modern , pass-oriented NFL ) as well as subbing in for the starting corners . In certain packages ( or if injuries depleted the depth chart ) , smaller free safeties or strong safeties can fill the spot of nickelback , as well . Their role may become that of a pass rusher from outside the box . \n \n In Canadian football , where five defensive backs are considered the norm , the position is known as a defensive halfback .",

The work was one of a series of nudes painted by Modigliani in 1917 that created a sensation when exhibited in Paris that year . On November 2 , 2010 , the painting sold at a New York auction for $ 68.9 million , a record price for an artwork by Modigliani . \n \n The several dozen nudes Modigliani painted between 1916 and 1919 constitute many of his best-known works . Simultaneously abstracted and erotically detailed , they exhibit a formal grace referencing nude figures of the Italian Renaissance while at the same time objectifying their subjects ' sexuality ; they `` exemplify his position between tradition and modernism '' . The nudes of this period are `` displayed boldly , with only the faintest suggestion of setting .... neither demure nor provocative , they are depicted with a degree of objectivity . Yet the uniformly thick , rough application of paint— as if applied by a sculptor 's hand— is more concerned with mass and the visceral perception of the female body than with titillation and the re-creation of translucent , tactile flesh '' . \n \n This series of nudes was commissioned by Modigliani 's dealer and friend Leopold Zborowski , who lent the artist use of his apartment , supplied models and painting materials , and paid him between fifteen and twenty francs each day for his work . The paintings from this arrangement were thus different from his previous depictions of friends and lovers in that they were funded by Zborowski either for his own collection , as a favor to his friend , or with an eye to their `` commercial potential '' , rather than originating from the artist 's personal circle of acquaintances . \n \n The Paris show of 1917 was Modigliani 's only solo exhibition during his life , and is `` notorious '' in modern art history for its sensational public reception and the attendant issues of obscenity . The show was closed by police on its opening day , but continued thereafter , most likely after the removal of paintings from the gallery 's streetfront window . \n \n According to the catalogue description from the 2010 sale at Sotheby 's , seven nudes were exhibited in the 1917 show , four of them titled Nu ; `` the present work may have been among these pictures .... the models ' permissiveness and the artist 's accessibility to them implied that these oils were post coital-renderings , the women still flush and basking in the afterglow '' . \n \n In 1999 Nude Sitting on a Divan sold at Sotheby 's for $ 16.7 million , a record price for a painting by the artist . The most recent sale far surpassed the pre-sale estimate of $ 40 million , as well as the previous record for one of Modigliani 's works , $ 52.6 million for a sculpture . \n \n Notes",

The Don passes through Alford , Kemnay , Inverurie , Kintore , and Dyce . Its main tributary , the River Ury , joins at Inverurie . \n \n Course of the river \n \n The Don rises in the peat flat beneath Druim na Feithe , and in the shadow of Glen Avon , before flowing quietly past the ice-age moraine and down to Cock Bridge , below the picturesque site of the recently demolished Delnadamph Lodge . Several streams , the Dhiver , Feith Bhait , Meoir Veannaich , Cock Burn and the Allt nan Aighean merge to form the embryonic Don . Water from the north of Brown Cow Hill ( ) drains into the Don , while water from the west side runs into the River Spey and that from the south side into the Dee . The Don follows a circuitous route eastwards past Corgarff Castle , through Strathdon and the Howe of Alford before entering the North Sea just north of Old Aberdeen . \n \n The chief tributaries are Conrie Water , Ernan Water , Water of Carvie , Water of Nochty , Deskry Water , Water of Buchat , Kindy Burn , Bucks Burn , Mossat Burn , Leochel Burn and the River Ury . \n \n History \n \n The river was recorded by the 2nd century AD cosmographer Ptolemy of Alexandria ( d. c 168 ) as Δηουανα Devona , meaning 'goddess ' , an indication the river was once a sacred one . Near Kintore , not distant from the Don , is the Deers Den Roman Camp . In 1750 the Don 's lower reaches were channelled towards the sea , moving its confluence with the sea northwards . \n \n Hydrology \n \n River levels and flows have been measured along the course of the Don at a number of gauging stations since 1969 . The lowest of these is the gauge at Parkhill near Dyce , with a mean flow of . The station measures 97 % of the total 1312 km2 catchment area of the river . \n \n Prior to 2016 the maximum levels and flows were recorded during the floods of November 2002 , with peak levels on the 22nd of that month reaching at Haughton near Inverurie , and at Parkhill . These maxima where exceeded in January 2016 during the 2015–16 floods , when levels at Haughton reached , whilst those at Parkhill were over a metre higher than previously at . The resultant flooding forced residents along the river to evacuate their homes , in some cases with the help of local rescue teams . Areas affected included Port Elphinstone , Kintore , and Donside in Aberdeen where a number of residential care homes were evacuated as a precaution . \n \n Economy \n \n Strathdon attracts visitors for salmon and trout fishing as well as its castles and scenery .",

          "context": "Maxwell Montes is a mountain massif on the planet Venus , of which a peak ( Skadi Mons ) is the highest point on the planet 's surface . \n \n General description \n \n Located on Ishtar Terra , the more northern of the planet 's two major highlands , Maxwell Montes is 11 km high . It rises about above and to the east of Lakshmi Planum , and is about 853 km long by 700 km wide . The western slopes are very steep , whereas the eastern slopes descend gradually into Fortuna Tessera . Due to its elevation it is the coolest ( about 380 °C ) and least pressurised ( about 45 bar ) location on the surface of Venus . \n \n Origins and geology \n \n The origin of the Lakshmi Planum and the mountain belts such as Maxwell Montes is controversial . One theory suggests they formed over a hot plume of material rising from the interior of the planet , while another says the region is being compressed ( pushed together ) from all sides , resulting in material descending into the interior of the planet . The broad ridges and valleys making up Maxwell Montes and Fortuna Tessera suggest that the topography resulted from compression . The parallel ridges and valleys were cut by later extensional faults . The extreme height of Maxwell Montes in relation to other compressional mountain ranges around Lakshmi Planum suggests that its origin is more complex . \n \n Most of Maxwell Montes has a bright radar return which is common on Venus at high altitudes . This phenomenon is thought to result from the presence of a mineral , possibly a metallic snow . Early suggestions included pyrite and tellurium ; more recently , lead sulfide and bismuth sulfide have been proposed . \n \n Radar mapping and naming \n \n By using radar to probe through the permanent and thick clouds in the Venusian atmosphere and make observations of the surface , scientists at the American Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico discovered the extensive highland on Venus that came to be called Maxwell Montes in 1967 . \n \n In 1978 , the space probe Pioneer Venus 1 went into orbit around Venus for the purpose of making radar observations of the Venusian surface . These observations made possible the creation of the first topographic map of the surface of Venus , and confirmed that a point within Maxwell Montes is the highest point above the average level of the planet 's surface . \n \n Maxwell Montes is named for James Clerk Maxwell whose work in mathematical physics predicted the existence of radio waves , which made radar , and thus the surface observations of Venus , possible . \n \n Maxwell Montes , Alpha Regio , and Beta Regio are the three exceptions to the rule that the surface features of Venus are to be named for females . \n \n The name , originally given by Ray Jurgens in 1970 on the urging of Tommy Gold , was approved by the International Astronomical Union 's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature ( IAU/WGPSN ) between 1976 and 1979 .",

It is one of the most frequently used wedding marches , generally being played on a church pipe organ . \n \n At weddings in many Western countries , this piece is commonly used as a recessional , though frequently stripped of its episodes in this context . It is frequently teamed with the `` Bridal Chorus '' from Richard Wagner 's opera Lohengrin , or with Jeremiah Clarke 's `` Prince of Denmark 's March '' , both of which are often played for the entry of the bride . \n \n The first time that Mendelssohn 's `` Wedding March '' was used at a wedding was when Dorothy Carew wed Tom Daniel at St Peter 's Church , Tiverton , England , on 2 June 1847 when it was performed by organist Samuel Reay . However , it did not become popular at weddings until it was selected by Victoria , The Princess Royal for her marriage to Prince Frederick William of Prussia on 25 January 1858 . The bride was the daughter of Queen Victoria , who loved Mendelssohn 's music and for whom Mendelssohn often played while on his visits to Britain . \n \n An organ on which Mendelssohn gave recitals of the `` Wedding March '' , among other works , is housed in St Ann 's Church in Tottenham . \n \n Franz Liszt wrote a virtuoso transcription of the `` Wedding March and Dance of the Elves '' ( S. 410 ) in 1849-50 .

In English-speaking countries it is generally known as `` Here Comes the Bride '' or `` Wedding March '' , though `` wedding march '' refers to any piece in march tempo accompanying the entrance or exit of the bride , notably Felix Mendelssohn 's `` Wedding March '' . The piece was made popular when it was used as the processional at the wedding of Victoria the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia in 1858 . \n \n The chorus is sung in Lohengrin by the women of the wedding party after the ceremony , as they accompany the heroine Elsa to the bridal chamber . \n \n Text \n \n Although at most weddings the chorus is usually played on an organ without vocal singing , in Lohengrin the wedding party sings these words at the beginning of act three . \n \n Eight women then sing a blessing to a separate melody . \n \n The chorus then repeats the first section , gradually proceeding offstage . \n \n Religious attitudes \n \n Many pastors of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod oppose the `` Bridal Chorus '' because of both pre-First World War Lutheran opposition to the theater and the pagan elements of Wagner 's operas . The Roman Catholic Church generally does not use the `` Bridal Chorus '' ; one diocese 's guidelines regarding the chorus states that the chorus is a secular piece of music , that it is not a processional to the altar in the opera , and especially that its frequent use in film and television associate it with sentimentality rather than worship . The song is also not used in Eastern Orthodox weddings .",

          "context": "Shakoor Rana ( April 3 , 1936 – April 9 , 2001 ) was a Pakistani cricketer and umpire \n \n Playing career \n \n Shakoor Rana had an undistinguished playing career . He played in 11 first-class matches between 1957 and 1973 , accumulating 226 runs and 12 wickets . He was overshadowed by his brothers Shafqat Rana and Azmat Rana who both represented Pakistan at Test level . \n \n Umpiring career \n \n Rana made his international debut as an umpire in 1974 at Lahore , the city that had become his hometown . The match was between Pakistan and the West Indies . His career continued until his last match between Pakistan and New Zealand in 1996 , also at Lahore . He stood in 18 test matches and 22 One Day Internationals . \n \n Gatting controversy \n \n In a test match in Faisalabad in 1987 , Rana argued furiously with Mike Gatting . The argument stopped the match , and footage of the English cricket captain and the umpire shouting at each other with fingers waved in the other 's face was widely broadcast . \n \n The incident occurred on the second day of the test after Gatting was considered by Rana to have made an alteration to the fielding positions as Eddie Hemmings ran in to bowl - Rana stopped the game and accused Gatting of cheating . Rana had already upset the English by wearing a Pakistan sweater and placing Mudassar Nazar 's cap on his own head . The game was stopped by the incident and only resumed the following day . Rana and Gatting were both accused of using foul language , much of which was heard by a worldwide TV audience via the stump microphone . [ http : //news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/england_on_tour/976662.stm BBC SPORT | ENGLAND ON TOUR | Gatt regrets Rana row ] Shakoor refused to stand again in that Test until he received an unconditional apology from Gatting for the language used in the dispute . Gatting was threatened with being stripped of the England captaincy and was forced into issuing a written apology to Rana . Gatting has since expressed regret at his part in the row . \n \n Coney incident \n \n Gatting was not the only international captain to have had a run-in with Rana . In December 1984 during a Test match in Karachi , New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney threatened to lead his side from the field following a controversial decision of not-out for Pakistan player Javed Miandad . \n \n Legacy \n \n The controversy surrounding Shakoor Rana was a driver in the move towards neutral umpires at Test matches . The home side had previously supplied the umpires but the International Cricket Council have since brought in neutral officials .",

Most organizing committees then decided to include at least one demonstration sport at each edition of the Games , usually some typical or popular sport in the host country , like baseball at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and taekwondo at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games . From 1912 to 1992 , only two editions of the Summer Olympics did not have demonstration sports on their program .

Traditionally , the medals awarded for the demonstration events followed the same design as the Olympic medals , but of a smaller size . They are never included in the medal count . \n \n Demonstration sports were suspended after the 1992 Summer Olympics , as the Olympic program grew bigger and it became more difficult for the organizing committees to give them the appropriate attention , since the IOC required the same treatment to be dispensed for official and demonstration sports . It is unlikely that they will be reintroduced as a requirement for future Olympic organizing committees . However , the Beijing Olympic Committee received permission from the IOC to run a wushu competition parallel to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games , Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008 . \n \n From the 1984 Summer Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics , two Paralympic events ( a men 's and a women 's wheelchair racing event ) were included in the athletics programme of each Games .

Other words for spans of years also come from Latin : biennium ( 2 years ) , triennium ( 3 years ) , quadrennium ( 4 years ) , lustrum ( 5 years ) , score ( 20 years ) , century ( 100 years ) , millennium ( 1000 years ) . \n \n Distinctions \n \n Although any period of 10 years is a decade , a convenient and frequently referenced interval is based on the tens digit of a calendar year , as in using `` 1960s '' to represent the decade from 1960 to 1969 . Often , for brevity , only the tens part is mentioned ( 60s or sixties ) , although this may leave it uncertain which century is meant . These references are frequently used to encapsulate popular culture or other widespread phenomena that dominated such a decade , as in The Great Depression of the 1930s . \n \n Because the common calendar starts with year 1 , its first full decade is the years 1 to 10 , the second decade from 11 to 20 , and so on . So although the `` 1960s '' comprises the years 1960 to 1969 , the `` 197th decade '' spans 1961 to 1970 . \n \n A decade may also refer to an arbitrary span of 10 years . For example , the statement `` during his last decade , Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time '' , merely refers to the last 10 years of Mozart 's life without regard to which calendar years are encompassed . \n \n For decades of the 20th century , the term 'decade ' often conjures not just a set of ten years but a distinct era roughly approximating those ten years - for example , the sixties often refer to events that took place between c. 1964 and 1972 and conjure memories of the counterculture , flower power , protests of 1968 and other things going on at the time .",

The earlier conflict restarted after the truce between the two kings— just long enough to see the harvest in , according to the chronicler Roger of Hoveden— expired . Both kings invaded and pillaged each other 's territory , causing great suffering to the local population by having their captives ' eyes put out . \n \n Richard advanced through French territory by capturing several castles , most notably , the castle of Courcelles ( of which the imposing unique oval donjon remains ) and the stronghold at Burris . The French king tried to recapture Courcelles as he marched from Mante with 300 knights and a gathering of footsoldiers and citizens . The two forces met , after the Frankish army — which was superior in numbers — changed directions and advanced towards Gisors . The English defeated the French and captured many prominent knights , as well as riderless horses . The French fled the field by crossing the bridge at the town of Gisors , which broke down under their weight , `` and the king of France , as we have heard say , had to drink of the river '' Richard reported to the Bishop of Durham ; with the French king struggling for his life , his troops managed to pull him out of the water . The impregnable fortress of Gisors remained in French hands , nevertheless . \n \n The battle was followed by another temporary truce , made at Vernon . \n \n Allegedly , before Gisors , Richard coined as countersign the parole of the day to tell friend from foe , `` Dieu et mon droit '' , a denial of his fealty to the King of France . By this motto , Richard attested that he owed his kingdom— and Normandy , Aquitaine and Anjou— to God and his right alone .",

          "context": "Port and starboard are nautical terms for left and right , respectively . Port is the left-hand side of or direction from a vessel , facing forward . Starboard is the right-hand side , facing forward . Since port and starboard never change , they are unambiguous references that are not relative to the observer . \n \n The term starboard derives from the Old English steorbord , meaning the side on which the ship is steered . Before ships had rudders on their centrelines , they were steered with a steering oar at the stern of the ship and , because more people are right-handed , on the right-hand side of it . The term is cognate with the Old Norse stýri ( rudder ) and borð ( side of a ship ) . Since the steering oar was on the right side of the boat , it would tie up at wharf on the other side . Hence the left side was called port . \n \n Formerly larboard was used instead of port . This is from Middle-English ladebord and the term lade is related to the modern load . Larboard sounds similar to starboard and in 1844 the Royal Navy ordered that port be used instead . Larboard continued to be used well into the 1850s by whalers . In Old English the word was bæcbord , of which cognates are used in other European languages , for example as the German backbord and the French term bâbord ( derived in turn from Middle Dutch ) . \n \n At night , the port side of a vessel or aircraft is indicated with a red navigation light and the opposite side with a green one , to help avoid collisions . The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea state that a ship on the left must give way to a ship on its right . If the courses of two boats are intersecting , the helmsman usually gives way to a red light by going around the stern of the stand-on vessel . Sidelights are each lit from right ahead to 22.5 degrees abaft the beam on its corresponding side . A mnemonic for this is `` If to starboard red appear , 't is your duty to keep clear . Green to green , red to red perfect safety , go ahead . ''",

This is the northern solstice in the northern hemisphere and the southern solstice in the southern hemisphere . Depending on the shift of the calendar , the summer solstice occurs some time between June 20 and June 22 in the northern hemisphere and between December 20 and December 23 each year in the southern hemisphere . The same dates in the opposite hemisphere are referred to as the winter solstice . \n \n When on a geographic pole , the Sun reaches its greatest height , the moment of solstice , it can be noon only along that longitude which at that moment lies in the direction of the Sun from the pole . For other longitudes , it is not noon . Noon has either passed or has yet to come . Hence the notion of a solstice day is useful . The term is colloquially used like midsummer to refer to the day on which solstice occurs .

It passes over the Rio di Palazzo and connects the New Prison ( Prigioni Nuove ) to the interrogation rooms in the Doge 's Palace . It was designed by Antonio Contino ( whose uncle Antonio da Ponte had designed the Rialto Bridge ) and was built in 1600 . \n \n The view from the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment . The bridge name , given by Lord Byron as a translation from the Italian `` Ponte dei sospiri '' in the 19th century , comes from the suggestion that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the window before being taken down to their cells .

A sump can also be an infiltration basin used to manage surface runoff water and recharge underground aquifers . Sump can also refer to an area in a cave where an underground flow of water exits the cave into the earth . \n \n Examples \n \n One common example of a sump is the lowest point in a basement , into which flows water that seeps in from outside . If this is a regular problem , a sump pump that moves the water outside of the house may be used . \n \n Another example is the oil pan of an engine . The oil is used to lubricate the engine 's moving parts and it pools in a reservoir known as its sump , at the bottom of the engine . Use of a sump requires the engine to be mounted slightly higher to make space for it . Often though , oil in the sump can slosh during hard cornering , starving the oil pump . For these reasons , racing and piston aircraft engines are `` dry sumped '' using scavenge pumps and a swirl tank to separate oil from air , which is also sucked up by the pumps . \n \n A sump can also be found in an aquarium , mainly a reef system . The sump sits below the main tank and is used as a filter , as well as a holding place of unsightly equipment such as heaters and protein skimmers . The main advantage of having a sump plumbed into an aquarium is the increase of water in the system , making it more stable and less prone to fluctuations of pH and salinity . \n \n A diving snorkel can have a sump section located below the mouthpiece . This allows excess moisture from the breath and liquid from the ocean to settle and remain in the sump , so that it does not impair the snorkeler 's breathing . \n \n In a nuclear power plant 's reactor housing , the role of the sump will be to collect any overflow of primary loop coolant ; in this case , monitoring and pumping of the sump is an important part of the reactor 's safety system . \n \n The equivalent of a sump on a boat is the bilge . \n \n In the human eye , the vitreous humour has a minor role as a metabolic sump . \n \n Other uses \n \n In a foxhole , a grenade sump is a deeper hole dug inside the foxhole into which live grenades can be kicked to minimize damage from the explosion . \n \n In medieval cosmology , the sump was the center of the cosmos , where the dregs and filth descended , with the celestial sphere far exalted above the world of fallen man . \n \n In Finnish spoken language a direct derivative `` sumppi '' refers to coffee that tastes bad when it is n't consumed fast enough after it has been made .",

His father , Paul Marioni , was involved in the American studio glass movement and , as a result , Dante was constantly exposed to the glassblowing artists of the San Francisco Bay Area . In 1979 , the Marioni family moved to Seattle and Dante began to study glassblowing at The Glass Eye . He spent summers at the Pilchuck Glass School in Stanwood , Washington where his father taught . After graduating from high school , he started to pursue glassblowing as a career ; working full-time at The Glass Eye . Marioni learned the art of glassblowing from masters like Lino Tagliapietra , Benjamin Moore , and Richard Marquis . He has taught in the United States , Australia , New Zealand , Japan , and Europe . \n \n About his work \n \n Marioni ’ s ensemble of glass vessels includes variations of vases , goblets , flasks , cups , and pitchers . His works reveal combinations of classical Greek , Italian , and modern forms using opaque and transparent colors . Some of Marioni ’ s pieces employ 'reticello ' , which resembles a net , and murrine ( mosaic ) techniques . As he has refined his technical skills , he tends to design with tall , sleek shapes .

He received his Ph.D at Ohio State University . In 1964 Fritz received a scholarship from Harvey Littleton to participate in a four-week glass seminar at the University of Wisconsin . Russell Day was also in attendance ; Marvin Lipofsky , a student of Littleton 's who later founded a glass program at the University of California , Berkeley , assisted with demonstrations . Shortly before the seminar , Fritz attended the World Congress of Craftsmen , which was held at Columbia University in New York City . There he watched Littleton and his students demonstrate glassblowing on a furnace designed and constructed by Dominick Labino . Fritz also met glass artist Sam Herman at this time . \n The 1960s studio glass movement was born in 1962 when Harvey Littleton conducted a workshop at the Toledo Museum of Art with Dominic Labino and others . It was Littleton ’ s intention to , as he put it , `` suggest the dimensions of glass as a medium for the artist .

Its man-made dam , `` Embalse Casa de Piedra , '' serves both to generate hydroelectricity for the arid region the river traverses , and to regulate the river 's water level . \n \n Course \n \n Its sources are on the eastern slopes of the Andes in the same latitude as the Chilean volcano Tinguiririca ( about 34° 48 ' S. ) , and it pursues a generally east-southeast course to the Atlantic Ocean , where it discharges about 100 to south of Bahía Blanca , through several channels of a delta of the Unión Bay extending from latitude 39° 30 ' to 39° 50 ' S. Its total length is about 1000 km , of which about 300 km , from the coast up to Pichi Mahuida , are navigable for vessels of up to 2 m draft . It is nearly 2000 km if calculated Río Desaguadero within . \n \n The river has usually been described as formed by the confluence of the Grande and the Barrancas . However , since the Barrancas is only a small stream compared to the Grande , it is more accurate to describe the Barrancas as a tributary that joins the main river , which is known as the `` Grande '' above where the Barrancas joins it , and the `` Colorado '' below that point . After leaving the vicinity of the Andes , the Colorado flows through a barren , arid territory , and receives no tributary of note except the Salado ( or Curacó ) from La Pampa Province—although it was once an outlet of the now-closed lake basin of Laguna Urre Lauquen . The bottom lands of the Colorado , in its course across Patagonia , are fertile and wooded , but too small in area to support more than a small , scattered population .",

This happens in climates where the rate of water evaporation exceeds the rate of precipitation , that is , in a desert . If the water can not drain into the ground , it remains on the surface until it evaporates , leaving behind minerals precipitated from the salt ions dissolved in the water .

The implication is of a slow , passionate kiss which is considered intimate , romantic , erotic or sexual . Slang synonyms include `` swapping spit '' and `` tonsil hockey '' . \n A `` kiss with the tongue '' stimulates the partner 's lips , tongue and mouth , which are sensitive to the touch . The practice is usually considered a source of pleasure . The oral zone is one of the principal erogenous zones of the body . \n \n Anthropologists are divided into two schools on the origins of kissing , one believing that it is instinctual and intuitive and the other that it evolved from what is known as kiss feeding , a process used by mothers to feed their infants by passing chewed food to their babies ' mouths . \n \n Etymology \n \n A French kiss is so-called because at the beginning of the 20th century , the French had a reputation for more adventurous and passionate sex practices . In France , it is referred to as un baiser amoureux ( `` a lover 's kiss '' ) or un baiser avec la langue ( `` a kiss with the tongue '' ) , even if in past times it was also known as baiser Florentin ( `` Florentine kiss '' ) . The Petit Robert 2014 French dictionary , released on May 30 , 2013 , added the French verb `` se galocher '' — slang for kissing with tongues — making it the first time a single word described the practice ( except in Quebec , where the verb `` frencher '' means French kissing , Australia , where the term `` pash '' is used and the German verb `` knutschen '' ) . \n \n Disease risks \n \n French kissing carries moderate risk of HPV . The possibility of contracting HIV from French kissing would be extremely rare , and then only if lips or gums were bleeding . The CDC considers transmission of Hepatitis B via French kissing to be an unlikely mode of infection . Occasionally syphilis can be passed through prolonged French kissing , but this usually requires contact with an active lesion . French kissing is an unlikely mode of transmission of infection by Hepatitis B or gonorrhea .",

It is host to Baku , the biggest and the most populous city of the country , and also the Baku metropolitan area , with its satellite cities Sumgayit and Khyrdalan . \n \n There are three districts , of which two are urban ( Baku and Sumgayit ) , and one ( Absheron Rayon ) , is suburban district in Absheron region . \n \n It extends 60 km eastward into the Caspian Sea , and reaches a maximum width of 30 km . Though technically the easternmost extension of the Caucasus Mountains , the landscape is only mildly hilly , a gently undulating plain that ends in a long spit of sand dunes known as Shah Dili , and now declared the Absheron National Park . In this part the peninsula is dissected by ravines and characterized by frequent salt lakes . \n \n Etymology \n \n The etymology is as follows : The word Absheron consists of a few parts . Ab means water , shour means salty and an is the suffix that makes plural in Persian . So , Abshouran , which came out these words , means `` place of salty water '' . This is also the name of a city in Russia which is called Apsheronsk . \n \n According to Conrad Malte-Brun in 1810 , an alternative name for the peninsula was Okoressa . \n \n Geography \n \n The Absheron Peninsula is nearly the metropolitan area of Baku because the Baku metropolitan area consists of Baku city , Sumgayit and Khyrdalan whereas the Absheron Peninsula consists of Baku city , Sumgayit and Absheron rayon whose center is Khyrdalan . \n \n Climate \n \n The Absheron Peninsula , has a temperate semi-arid climate ( Köppen climate classification : BSk ) with warm and dry summers , cool and occasionally wet winters , and strong winds all year long . The peninsula is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ( precipitation here is around or less than 200 mm a year ) . The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer , but none of these seasons are particularly wet . The natural vegetation of the Absheron Peninsula is dry steppe and semi-desert . Due to the semi-arid climate , local agriculture requires irrigation . \n \n Economy \n \n Beginning in the 1870s , the Absheron Peninsula was the site of some of the world 's earliest petroleum production . Much of the landscape remains scarred with rusting oil derricks . Despite serious problems with environmental damage and pollution , the Absheron is known for its flowers , horticulture , mulberries and figs . The northern coast has wide though less-than-pristine beaches which are popular local tourist attractions . \n \n Wealthy people have settled in the Absheron Peninsula , including Robert Nobel and Zeynalabdin Taghiyev .",

          "context": "Advocaat or advocatenborrel is a traditional Dutch alcoholic beverage made from eggs , sugar and brandy . The rich and creamy drink has a smooth , custard-like flavor and is similar to eggnog . The typical alcohol content is generally somewhere between 14 % and 20 % ABV . Its contents may be a blend of egg yolks , aromatic spirits , sugar or honey , brandy , vanilla and sometimes cream ( or evaporated milk ) . Notable makers of advocaat include Bols , DeKuyper and Verpoorten . \n \n Etymology \n \n Advocaat is the Dutch word for `` lawyer '' . As the name of the drink , it is short for advocatenborrel , or `` lawyer 's drink '' , where borrel is Dutch for a shot of an alcoholic beverage . According to the 1882 edition of the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche taal ( Dictionary of the Dutch Language ) , it is `` zoo genoemd als een goed smeersel voor de keel , en dus bijzonder dienstig geacht voor een advocaat , die in 't openbaar het woord moet voeren '' ( `` so named as a good lubricant for the throat , and thus considered especially useful for a lawyer , who must speak in public . '' \n \n Types and uses \n \n Thick advocaat is sold mainly on the Dutch and Belgian market , though in lesser quantities it can also be found in German and Austrian markets . It is often eaten with a little spoon , while a more liquid version is sold as an export . Thick advocaat contains egg yolks , and is used as a waffle or poffertjes topping and as an ingredient for several kinds of desserts such as ice cream , custards and pastries . It is also served as an apéritif or digestif in a wide glass with whipped cream and cocoa powder sprinkled on top . \n \n In the export variety whole eggs are used . The best known cocktail using advocaat is the Snowball : a mixture of advocaat , sparkling lemonade and sometimes lime juice , ( although this is not required for the drink ) that is often consumed near Christmas . Another is the Fluffy duck , made with rum . A highly popular advocaat-based beverage is the Bombardino , a drink commonly found in Italian ski resorts , particularly the Italian Alps , made by mixing advocaat , brandy , and whipped cream . \n \n Related drinks \n \n The Polish equivalent called ajerkoniak ( de : Eier—eggs ; fr : Cognac ) is based on vodka instead of brandy , despite what the name may suggest . \n \n Rompope of Mexico , and Sabajón of Colombia are very similar liquors based on egg yolk and vanilla . Some varieties have additional flavourings . \n \n Popular culture \n \n It was featured in the Stanley Kubrick movie The Shining as the drink spilled on Jack Nicholson by the Butler in the famous Gold Room scene .",

It is a traditional meal in Bavaria , Poland , and Hungary . In Bavaria and Poland , special dishes are made exclusively to be eaten during second breakfast . In Vienna and most other parts of Austria the second breakfast is referred to as Jause . It is typical to eat four to five meals a day in these locations . \n \n Details \n \n The second breakfast is typically a lighter meal or snack eaten around 10:30 in the morning ( its Hungarian name , tízórai , actually means `` [ snack ] at 10 '' ) . It consists of coffee and pastries or some sausages . The typical sausage is a white sausage , Weißwurst , which is considered the specialty of Munich . The sausage is prepared during the early morning to serve during the second breakfast . It is served with pretzels , sweet mustard , and wheat beer . The meal is roughly similar in concept to the British elevenses , though elevenses is little more than a colloquial term for a mid-morning snack . In Poland second breakfast usually consists of some snacks like sandwiches , or pastries , but may consist of light dessert-type dishes like chocolate pudding or kisiel . \n \n First and second breakfast is also a common custom in farm areas of North America . Farmers who need to rise early to tend to animals or perform other chores may eat a small `` first breakfast '' , such as toast and coffee , just after rising , followed by a heartier second breakfast after the first round of chores is done . \n \n In literature and film \n \n In J. R. R. Tolkien 's novel The Hobbit , the protagonist , Bilbo Baggins , eats a second breakfast , and in the preface to its sequel , The Lord of the Rings , Tolkien mentions that hobbits prefer to eat six meals a day . In Peter Jackson 's film adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring , as Aragorn is leading the hobbits on a march , Pippin – hoping for a meal break – is horrified when Merry tells him that the man probably does n't know about second breakfast . Pippin goes on to ask if he knows about the other meals commonly eaten by hobbits , including elevenses , luncheon , afternoon tea , dinner , and supper . Kindly , Aragorn throws an apple to each of the pair to tide them over until their next `` regular '' meal break . \n \n In Thomas Mann 's books The Magic Mountain or Buddenbrooks , frequent and detailed references are made to second breakfasts . Beer is served along with `` cold cuts on toast '' . Sometimes food from the first breakfast appears again such as oatmeal and fruit . In fact , Mann refers in Magic Mountain to `` third breakfasts '' as well .",

He was the second youngest of the five Marx Brothers . Born in New York City , he worked with his brothers on the vaudeville circuit , but left acting when he was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War I ( years before his brothers Chico , Harpo , Groucho and Zeppo began their film career ) . \n \n Life and career \n \n Marx was born in Manhattan , New York City on October 23 , 1893 . His parents were Sam Marx ( called `` Frenchie '' throughout his life ) , and his wife , Minnie Schoenberg Marx . Marx 's family was Jewish . His mother was from Dornum in East Frisia ; and his father was a native of Alsace , and worked as a tailor . \n \n Gummo , who in an interview said he never liked being on stage , left the group and joined the military during World War I . He was n't sent overseas since the armistice was signed shortly after . Gummo 's younger brother Zeppo took his place in the group . Gummo later went into the raincoat business . After his Army career he joined with his brother Zeppo Marx and operated a theatrical agency . After that collaboration ended , Gummo represented his brother Groucho Marx and worked on the television show The Life of Riley , which he helped develop . He also represented other on-screen talent and a number of writers . Gummo was well respected as a businessman . He rarely had contracts with those he represented , his philosophy being that , if they liked his work , they would continue to use him , and if not , they would seek representation elsewhere . \n \n Gummo was given his nickname because he had a tendency to be sneaky backstage , and creep up on others without them knowing ( like a gumshoe ) . Another explanation cited by biographers and family members is that Milton , being the sickliest of the brothers , often wore rubber overshoes , also called `` gumshoes , '' to protect himself from taking sick in inclement weather . \n \n Personal life \n \n He married Helen von Tilzer on March 16 , 1929 . Their son , Robert , was born in 1930 . \n \n Death \n \n Gummo died on April 21 , 1977 , at his home in Palm Springs , California , aged 84 from a cerebral hemorrhage . His death was never reported to Groucho , who by that time had become so ill and weak that it was thought the news would be a further detriment to his health . Groucho died four months later . \n \n Marx was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale , California . \n \n Family members \n \n His grandsons are actors Gregg Marx , Chris Marx , and actor/producer Brett Marx , who as a child actor appeared as 'Jimmy Feldman ' in 1976 's comedy film The Bad News Bears . \n \n When Richard J. Anobile asked Groucho in The Marx Bros. Scrapbook with which brother he was closest , Groucho replied . `` Gummo . He 's a nice man , and that 's more than I can say for Zeppo . ''",

It is a rectangular piece of unstitched cloth , usually around long , wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted at the waist . \n \n Etymology \n \n The word dhoti is derived from ( Sanskrit : धौती ) dhauti meaning to cleanse or wash . In context of garment , it simply refers to cleansed garment which was worn during shrauta sacrifices or religious session in general . Dhoti evolved from ancient Anatariya which was passed through legs , tucked at the back and covered the legs loosely , then flowed into a long pleats at front of the legs , the same way it is worn today . \n \n Regional names \n \n The garment is known by various regional names , such as : \n \n Custom and usage \n \n The pancha is worn by many orthodox Jain men when they visit the temple for puja ; unstitched clothing is believed by some Jains to be `` less permeable to pollution '' and therefore more appropriate for religious rituals than other garments . They also wear a loose , unstitched cloth , shorter than the pancha , on top . \n \n Hare Krishna , known for its distinctive dress code , prompts Western adherents to wear pancha , usually of saffron or white cloth folded in a traditional style . Mahatma Gandhi invariably wore a pancha on public occasions but , as he was aware that it was considered `` indecent '' to do so in other countries , was shocked when a friend wore one in London . Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was known for wearing a white silk dhoti .",

It has been operative since January 1 , 2015 . \n \n Geography \n \n The Metropolitcan City of Florence is bordered by the Metropolitan City of Bologna in the north , the province of Ravenna in the north-east , the province of Modena in the north-west , and the provinces of Pisa and Lucca in the west. , the province of Siena in the south and the province of Arezzo in the east and southeast . \n \n Much of its territory lies in the plain of the Arno river and has thus become an exurban sprawl around the city of Florence . The northeastern part of the metropolitcan city , in the Apennines , remains less developed . Romagna Granducale is the name given to the region lying on the northern slopes of Apennines . Corn , wine and silk are the chief products in the valley regions . Silk manufacturing was an important industry in the medieval times . The well known Renaissance artist Leonardo Da Vinci was born in Vinci which is a part of the Metropolitican City of Florence . The capital Florence is a well known cultural and a large tourist centre . \n \n Main sights \n \n The Metropolitan City receives large number of tourists every year . \n \n The capital city Florence has been recognised as UNESCO World Heritage Site . Major tourist attractions of the city are Piazza del Duomo , Duomo of Santa Maria del Fiore , the Baptistery of San Giovanni , Giotto 's Bell Tower , the Loggia del Bigallo and Museo dell'Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore , Ponte Vecchio and many others . \n \n Sights in Barberino di Mugello include Cattani Castle and Palazzo Pretorio .

Like many such rhymes , its origins are unclear . Some claim it was written by Dr Thomas Muffet ( d.1604 ) , an English physician and entomologist , regarding his stepdaughter Patience ; others claim it refers to Mary , Queen of Scots ( 1543–87 ) , who was said to have been frightened by religious reformer John Knox ( 1510–72 ) . The former explanation is speculative and the latter is doubted by most literary scholars , who note that stories linking folk tales or songs to political events are often urban legends.I . Opie and P. Opie , The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes ( Oxford : Oxford University Press , 1951 , 2nd ed. , 1997 ) , pp . 323–4 .

In the nineteenth century the rhyme existed in many alternative versions including : 'Little Mary Ester , Sat upon a tester ' ( 1812 ) ; 'Little Miss Mopsey , Sat in the shopsey ' ( 1842 ) . These rhymes may be parodies of whichever is the original . \n \n In the 1960 revue Beyond the Fringe , the English humourist and musician Dudley Moore sang `` Little Miss Muffet '' in the style of Peter Pears to music parodying Benjamin Britten . \n \n The Eagles ( band ) referred to the Porsche 550 Spyder and the death of James Dean in the song `` James Dean '' , using the popular poem in the song . \n \n A humorous , and profane , remake was also done by the American comedian Andrew `` Dice '' Clay , as well as the 2 Live Crew in the song `` Dirty Nursery Rhymes '' on As Nasty As They Wan na Be .",

The advertisements were designed by the Doyle Dane Bernbach ad agency , with the goal of distinguishing 100 % -Colombian coffee from coffee blended with beans from other countries . He typically appears with his mule Conchita , carrying sacks of harvested coffee beans . He has become an icon for Colombia as well as coffee in general , and Juan Valdez 's iconic appearance is frequently mimicked or parodied in television and other media . \n \n The Juan Valdez character is used as an ingredient brand , to specifically denote coffee beans that are only grown and harvested in Colombia . Part of the advertising campaign includes convincing consumers that there are specific benefits of Colombian-grown and harvested coffee beans , `` including how soil components , altitude , varieties and harvesting methods create good flavor . '' The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia is entirely owned and controlled by Colombia 's coffee farmers , ( cafeteros ) which number over 500,000 people . \n \n History \n \n Juan Valdez was initially portrayed by José F. Duval in both print advertisements and on television until 1969 . José Duval died in 1993 at the age of 72 . \n \n Juan Valdez had been embodied by Carlos Sánchez since 1969 and voiced by Norman Rose . Sánchez played Valdez in a brief sequence in the 2003 comedy film Bruce Almighty . In 2006 , Sánchez announced his retirement , and Carlos Castañeda , a grower from the town of Andes , Antioquia , was selected by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia as the new face of Juan Valdez . \n \n Brand \n \n There were 238 Juan Valdez coffee shops in 2013 , 135 in Colombia and 35 shops in other countries . Juan Valdez brand coffee is available in Chile , Costa Rica , Aruba , Ecuador , El Salvador , Panama , Spain , Kuwait , and the United States at supermarkets and Juan Valdez coffee shops . \n \n Controversies \n \n The name `` Juan Valdez '' is by no means unique , as both Juan and Valdez are common Spanish-language names and there are possibly thousands of men with this name alive today ( although the Valdez name is hardly known in the coffee growing regions of Colombia ) ; this became relevant in a 2006 lawsuit over the phrase `` Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee '' . \n \n The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia sued cartoonist Mike Peters , creator of Mother Goose & Grimm , for a cartoon talking about Juan Valdez and Colombian coffee in January 2009 . In a weeklong series making fun of various commercial products , he referenced violence in Colombia by having a character say : `` Y'know , there 's a big crime syndicate in Colombia . So when they say there 's a little bit of Juan Valdez in every can , maybe they 're not kidding .

Cooking of Kix occurs in the extruder , then the dough is formed into the desired shape by extrusion through a die . It was the first cereal to be manufactured using this process . \n \n Experimentation with this puffing process led to other popular brands like Cheerios . \n \n Promotions \n \n In 1947 , Kix offered a Lone Ranger atomic bomb ring in exchange for a box top and 15 cents . The ring contained a spinthariscope , so that when the red base ( which served as a `` secret message compartment '' ) was taken off , and after a period of time for dark adaptation , you could look through a small plastic lens at scintillations caused by polonium alpha particles striking a zinc sulfide screen . \n Advertising slogans \n \n The slogan `` Kid Tested .

The variety most commonly associated with the name in English is of Ukrainian origin and includes beetroots as one of the main ingredients , which gives the dish a distinctive red color . It shares the name , however , with a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots , such as sorrel-based green borscht , rye-based white borscht , cabbage borscht , etc . \n \n Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems , leaves and umbels of common hogweed , a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows , which lent the dish its Slavic name . With time , it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups , among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular . It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables , which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage , carrots , onions , potatoes and tomatoes . Depending on the recipe , borscht may include meat or fish , or be purely vegetarian ; it may be served either hot or cold ; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a dainty clear broth or a smooth refreshing drink . It is often served with smetana or sour cream , hard-boiled eggs and/or potatoes , but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes , such as ' or ' , that can be served with the soup . \n \n Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire , and – by way of migration – to other continents . In North America , borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites , the groups who first brought it there from Europe . Today , several ethnic groups claim borscht , in its variegated local guises , as their own national dish and consume it as part of ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox , Greek Catholic , Roman Catholic , and Jewish religious traditions . \n \n Etymology \n \n The English word borscht , also spelled borsch , borsht , or bortsch , comes from Yiddish ( ' ) . The latter derives from the word ( ' ) , which is common to East Slavic languages , such as Ukrainian or Russian . Together with cognates in other Slavic languages , it comes from Proto-Slavic * bŭrščǐ 'hogweed ' and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European * bhr̥sti- Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead , yet Borshchland lives on . Recipes , like birds , ignore political boundaries ... The faint outline of the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock , and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup , from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and , in emigration , from Brooklyn to Berlin .",

This is the kiss of Judas , also known ( especially in art ) as the Betrayal of Christ , which occurs in the Garden of Gethsemane after the Last Supper , and leads directly to the arrest of Jesus by the police force of the Sanhedrin ( Kilgallen 271 ) . \n \n More broadly , a Judas kiss may refer to `` an act appearing to be an act of friendship , which is in fact harmful to the recipient . '' \n \n In the New Testament \n \n Both Matthew ( 26:47–50 ) and Mark ( 14:43–45 ) use the Greek verb kataphilein , which means to kiss firmly , intensely , passionately , tenderly , or warmly . It is the same verb that Plutarch uses to describe a famous kiss that Alexander the Great gave Bagoas . According to Matthew , Jesus responded by saying : `` Friend , do what you are here to do . '' This has caused speculation that Jesus and Judas were actually in agreement with each other and that there was no real betrayal.Pagels , Elaine at Karen L.

          "context": "In biological classification , family ( , plural ' ) is one of the eight major taxonomic ranks ; it is classified between order and genus . A family may be divided into subfamilies , which are intermediate ranks above the rank of genus . In vernacular usage , a family may be named after one of its common members ; for example , walnuts and hickory trees belong to the family Juglandaceae , commonly known as the walnut family . \n \n What does or does not belong to a family—or whether a described family should be recognized at all—are proposed and determined by practicing taxonomists . There are no hard rules for describing or recognizing a family , or any taxa . Taxonomists often take different positions about descriptions of taxa , and there may be no broad consensus across the scientific community for some time . Some described taxa are accepted broadly and quickly , but others only rarely , if at all ; the publishing of new data and opinion often enables adjustments and consensus over time . \n \n Nomenclature \n \n The naming of families is codified by various international codes . \n * In fungal , algal , and botanical nomenclature , the family names of plants , fungi , and algae end with the suffix `` -aceae '' , with the exception of a small number of historic but widely used names including Compositae and Gramineae . \n * In zoological nomenclature , the family names of animals end with the suffix `` -idae '' . [ http : //www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ? article \n 29 & nfv= # 2 ] \n \n History \n \n The taxonomic term ' was first used by French botanist Pierre Magnol in his ' ( 1689 ) where he called the seventy-six groups of plants he recognised in his tables families ( ' ) . The concept of rank at that time was not yet settled , and in the preface to the ' Magnol spoke of uniting his families into larger ' , which is far from how the term is used today . \n \n Carolus Linnaeus used the word ' in his ' ( 1751 ) to denote major groups of plants : trees , herbs , ferns , palms , and so on . He used this term only in the morphological section of the book , discussing the vegetative and generative organs of plants . Subsequently , in French botanical publications , from Michel Adanson 's ' ( 1763 ) and until the end of the 19th century , the word ' was used as a French equivalent of the Latin ' ( or ' ) . In nineteenth-century works such as the ' of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and the ' of George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker this word ' was used for what now is given the rank of family . \n \n In zoology , the family as a rank intermediate between order and genus was introduced by Pierre André Latreille in his ' ( 1796 ) . He used families ( some of them were not named ) in some but not in all his orders of `` insects '' ( which then included all arthropods ) . \n \n Uses \n \n Families can be used for evolutionary , palaeontological and generic studies because they are more stable than lower taxonomic levels such as genera and species .",

The dance is one of the major audience-participation activities during screenings of the film and performances of the show . It has become a popular song beyond the reaches of the film and show , and is often played at dances and weddings . \n On The season one final of Free Play ( a show put out by Rooster Teeth ) Meg Turney and Ryan Haywood danced \n \n The song is in the key of A major . \n \n Placement \n \n `` The Time Warp '' was the fifth song in the original stage show ( after `` Science Fiction/Double Feature '' , `` Dammit Janet '' , `` Over at the Frankenstein Place '' and `` Sweet Transvestite '' ) , but fourth in the film ( following `` Over at the Frankenstein Place '' and preceding `` Sweet Transvestite '' ) . Stage productions continued to use the original placing until Richard O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 West End revival in which he moved the song to the film ’ s placing . For reasons of pacing , most productions now follow this order . \n \n The song begins at 19:35 in the DVD release . \n \n The song consists of verses sung by alternating characters , serving as the introduction to two of them , and choruses sung by the chorus of `` Transylvanians '' ( Movie ) or `` Phantoms '' ( Musical ) , and the Criminologist/Narrator ( played by Charles Gray in the movie ) . The characters that sing the verses are , in order , Riff-Raff ( Richard O'Brien in the movie ) , Magenta ( Patricia Quinn in the movie ) , and Columbia ( Little Nell Campbell in the film ) . After the second full chorus , Columbia often launches into her tap dance . \n \n The order of the solos varies in certain albums . In the movie and Roxy cast album , Columbia 's solo is right after Magenta 's , then Columbia does her tap dance after a second chorus . The version that has been in stage shows more recently is similar to the movie and Roxy cast , with Columbia singing her solo right after Magenta 's , but then she does her tap dance right after her solo , leaving only two choruses . Occasionally , Columbia 's solo and tap dance come after the chorus after Magenta 's solo . \n \n Meat Loaf 's voice is prominent in the chorus of the film version of the song . It is assumed that he is voicing a Transylvanian rather than the yet-to-be-introduced character of Eddie . \n \n The song is reprised/revisited briefly at the end of the film , in flashback , and in the show as an encore , led by Dr Frank N. Furter . \n \n In 1980 , the song reached number three on the Australian ARIA chart . \n \n Footnotes",

It is a popular souvenir for visitors to the US from Ireland or the UK . Big Red was also released in the early-mid 1980s in Australia , but was discontinued in late 1980s . Some specialty sweets shops , however , do still stock it . It was re-released in 2004 and again in late 2007 . It is also available in Mexico , Germany , Luxembourg , Latvia , Norway , Poland and parts of Sweden ; the gum sold in Germany , Norway and Poland is not red but white . It is meant to be hot in flavor . \n \n Despite it not being a sugarless gum , in 2003 in the United States , Wrigley 's replaced some of the sugar with aspartame and Ace K , both artificial sweeteners . \n \n The `` Big Red '' song \n \n Like its sister product , Juicy Fruit , Big Red had its own commercial jingle , which was used from 1979 to 1998 . The song was composed by Peter Cofield from Sunday Productions in New York City and sung by Ryan Devereaux . Many of the commercials depicted couples passionately kissing in a romantic setting for an unusually long time , always including one kisser who then must chase his departing ride . This commercial formula would later be parodied by a number of TV shows , including Saturday Night Live . \n \n In August 2008 , Wrigley teamed with popular singer-songwriter Ne-Yo to update the classic jingle . \n \n In February 2010 , Verizon Wireless repurposed the classic jingle for a television campaign featuring the company 's industry nickname , `` Big Red '' ( a reference to the color of the company 's logo ) .",

          "context": "In the United States of America , Mexican Coke ( ) or , informally , `` MexiCoke '' , refers to Coca-Cola produced in and imported from Mexico . \n \n Although intended for consumption in Mexico , Mexican Coca-Cola has become very popular in the United States because of a flavor that Coca-Cola fans call `` a lot more natural tasting '' . While many believe the primary difference in flavor between Mexican Coca-Cola and the American Coca-Cola formula is that Mexican Coke is sweetened using cane sugar as opposed to high-fructose corn syrup , a scientific analysis of Mexican Coke found no sucrose ( standard sugar ) in its sample of Mexican Coke , but instead found fructose and glucose levels similar to other soft drinks sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup . Coca-Cola claims that Mexican Coke exported to the United States is made with cane sugar , while some Mexican bottlers may use high-fructose corn syrup for drinks intended for sale in Mexico . Therefore , while Coca-Cola labeled `` Mexican '' in the U.S. is made with cane sugar , not all Coca-Cola sold in Mexico is . \n \n History \n \n Coca-Cola opened its first bottling franchise in Mexico in the 1920s with Grupo Tampico , and then Grupo ARMA . Monterrey-based FEMSA is currently the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico , along with most of Latin America . \n \n In 2013 , a Mexican Coca-Cola bottler announced it would stop using cane sugar in favor of glucose-fructose syrup . It later clarified this change would not affect those bottles especially exported to the United States as `` Coca-Cola Nostalgia '' products . \n \n Taste tests \n \n Results from taste tests have been mixed . In a taste test conducted by a local Westchester , New York magazine , tasters noted that the Mexican Coke had `` a more complex flavor with an ineffable spicy and herbal note '' , and that it contained something `` that darkly hinted at root beer or old-fashioned sarsaparilla candies '' . \n \n However , participants in a different double-blind taste test overwhelmingly preferred American Coca-Cola . Participants in taste tests conducted by Coca-Cola reported no perceptible differences in flavor between American Coke and the Mexican formulation . \n \n Bottle \n \n Mexican Coke is bottled in a thick 355 ml or 500 ml glass bottle , which some have described in contrast to the American Coke plastic bottles as being `` more elegant , with a pleasingly nostalgic shape '' . Instead of having a vinyl label wrapped around plastic , an enamel label is painted directly on the glass bottle . Most exporters of Mexican Coke affix a paper sticker containing the nutrition facts label , ingredients , and bottler and/or exporter 's contact information , to meet U.S. food labelling requirements . \n \n U.S. availability \n \n The World of Coca-Cola sells Mexican Coke in its gift store , and it is now widely available throughout the United States in stores and online . \n \n New Zealand \n \n A similar phenomenon exists in New Zealand , where Coca-Cola is available both bottled locally ( sweetened with sugar ) and imported from the United States ( with high-fructose corn syrup ) .",

The Upper Peninsula to the north has a more rural and jagged landscape than the more urban and level Lower Peninsula to the south . Separating the two parts are the Straits of Mackinac which joins Lake Michigan to Lake Huron at an even flow . Persons crossing between the two landmasses had to use ferries in sometimes ice-prone conditions until the construction of the Mackinac Bridge . Long tracts of shore along both peninsulas with several Great Lakes give Michigan the largest territorial waters of any state except Alaska ( which has thousands of miles of coast ) . The Lower Peninsula has a population that is well over an order of magnitude larger than that of the Upper Peninsula due to the presence of big cities including Detroit and Grand Rapids with histories of substantial manufacturing and technology employment . The cultural differences between the Michigan peninsulas tend to have greater meaning to residents of the Upper Peninsula than to those of the Lower Peninsula due to their reliance on forestry and mining which puts them at variance both economically and politically with the rest of the state .",

The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera , in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s , the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season . The owners of the theatre , usually noble amateurs , charged the impresario with hiring a composer ( until the 1850s operas were expected to be new ) and the orchestra , singers , costumes and sets , all while assuming considerable financial risk . In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor ( The Impresario ) . Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer ; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice , where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others . \n \n Alessandro Lanari ( 1787–1852 ) , who began as the owner of a shop that produced costumes , eliminated the middleman in a series of successful seasons he produced for the Teatro La Pergola , in Florence , which presented the premieres of the first version of Verdi 's Macbeth , two of Bellini 's operas and five of Donizetti 's , including Lucia di Lammermoor . Domenico Barbaia ( 1778–1841 ) began as a café waiter and made a fortune at La Scala , in Milan , where he was also in charge of the gambling operation and introduced roulette . \n \n Modern use \n \n The traditional term is still used in the entertainment industry to refer to a producer of concerts , tours and other events in music , opera , theatre and even rodeo . Important modern impresarios in the traditional sense include Thomas Beecham , Rudolf Bing , Sergei Diaghilev , Richard D'Oyly Carte , Fortune Gallo , Sol Hurok , Aaron Richmond , and jazz festival producer George Wein . \n \n Application of term \n \n The term is occasionally applied to others , such as independent art museum curators and conference organizers who have a leading role in orchestrating events . \n \n Figurative impresarios \n \n Jacques-Yves Cousteau said of himself that he was an impresario of scientists as an explorer and filmmaker who worked with scientists in underwater exploration . Nicholas Wade described James D. Watson and E. O. Wilson in The New York Times as impresarios of Charles Darwin 's works .",

The film , which stars Dirk Bogarde and features Marius Goring , David Oxley , and Cyril Cusack , is based on the 1950 book Ill Met by Moonlight : The Abduction of General Kreipe by W. Stanley Moss , which is an account of events during the author 's service on Crete during World War II as an agent of the Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) . The title is a quotation from Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream , and the book features the young agents ' capture and evacuation of the German general Heinrich Kreipe . \n \n Plot \n \n During World War II , the Greek Mediterranean island of Crete was occupied by the Nazis . British officers Major Patrick Leigh Fermor DSO ( Dirk Bogarde ) and Captain Bill Stanley Moss MC ( David Oxley ) of the Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) land on the island . With the help of the local Cretan resistance in April 1944 , they kidnap General Kreipe ( Marius Goring ) , the commander of the island . They take Kreipe across rough country to a secluded cove on the far side of the island , where they are picked up and taken to Cairo , the Middle East headquarters of British forces . \n \n Cast \n \n * Dirk Bogarde as Major Patrick `` Paddy '' Leigh Fermor aka `` Philedem '' \n * Marius Goring as Major General Heinrich Kreipe \n * David Oxley as Captain W.

Goring replaced Curt Jürgens , who was the original choice to play the part of General Kreipe . \n * Christopher Lee and David McCallum have small parts : Lee as a German officer in the dentist scene , and McCallum , in his film debut , as a sailor on the ship that picks up the group . Lee 's part was edited out of the 1959 American re-release of the film . A `` John Houseman '' in the cast does not appear to be the well-known actor and director John Houseman . \n \n Production \n \n Ill Met By Moonlight was filmed at Pinewood Studios in England , with location shooting in the Alpes-Maritimes in France and Italy , and on the Côte d'Azur in France . \n \n Box office \n \n The film was the seventh most popular movie at the British box office in 1957 . \n \n In popular culture \n \n The story was affectionately parodied by Spike Milligan in the 1957 Goon Show episode , `` Ill Met by Goonlight '' .",

Over 450 polo matches are held at the park each season and the highlight of the polo season is the annual British Open Polo Championship , for the Gold Cup , sponsored for many years by Veuve Clicquot , and from 2015 by Jaeger-LeCoultre . \n \n Cowdray House \n \n The estate also features the Cowdray House - the former home of the Montague family , built in 1542 and largely destroyed by fire in 1793 . In 2005 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a grant of £2.7m towards the cost of stabilising the ruins and they were opened to the public on 31 March 2007 . The house is not open to the public . \n \n In May 2009 it was announced that Lord Cowdray was seeking a business partner to turn the house into a country house hotel , but the project was abandoned when Cowdray failed to find a partner . It was also announced that Cowdray will be moving to another family property at Fernhurst . The following year , in September 2010 , it was announced that Cowdray House was put on the market for £25 million . Michael Pearson , the fourth Viscount Cowdray , claimed that he did not want his son to inherit the burden of maintaining the house . However , as of September 2011 , Lord Cowdray has not found a buyer for the house , which would not include the wider estate , including the Polo Club . The collection housed within Cowdray Park was auctioned in situ by Christie 's over three days , between September 13 and 15 2011 . Among the objects sold were furniture , silver , paintings , tapestries and porcelain , with a portrait previously identified as Queen Elizabeth I ( but now considered more likely to be Catherine Howard , née Carey , Countess of Nottingham ) achieving the highest auction price of £325,250 . In total , the auction raised £7.9 million . \n \n Notes",

          "context": "Old Faithful is a cone geyser located in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming , United States . Old Faithful was named in 1870 during the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to receive a name . It is one of the most predictable geographical features on Earth , erupting every 35 to 120 minutes . The geyser , as well as the nearby Old Faithful Inn , is part of the Old Faithful Historic District . \n \n History \n \n On the afternoon of September 18 , 1870 , the members of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition traveled down the Firehole River from the Kepler Cascades and entered the Upper Geyser Basin . The first geyser they saw was Old Faithful . In his 1871 Scribner 's account of the expedition , Nathaniel P. Langford wrote : \n \n In the early days of the park , Old Faithful was often used as a laundry : \n \n Eruptions \n \n Eruptions can shoot 3700 to of boiling water to a height of 106 to lasting from 1.5 to 5 minutes . The average height of an eruption is 145 ft. Intervals between eruptions can range from 35 to 120 minutes , averaging 66.5 minutes in 1939 , slowly increasing to an average of 90 minutes apart today . The time between eruptions has a bimodal distribution , with the mean interval being either 65 or 91 minutes . \n \n More than 137,000 eruptions have been recorded . Harry Woodward first described a mathematical relationship between the duration and intervals of the eruptions in 1938 . Old Faithful is not the tallest or largest geyser in the park ; those titles belong to the less predictable Steamboat Geyser . \n \n Increasing interval \n \n Over the years , the length of the interval has increased , which may be the result of earthquakes affecting subterranean water levels . These disruptions have made the earlier mathematical relationship inaccurate , but have in fact made Old Faithful more predictable . With a margin of error of 10 minutes , Old Faithful will erupt 65 minutes after an eruption lasting less than 2.5 minutes or 91 minutes after an eruption lasting more than 2.5 minutes . The reliability of Old Faithful can be attributed to the fact that it is not connected to any other thermal features of the Upper Geyser Basin . \n \n Measurement \n \n Between 1983 and 1994 , four probes containing temperature and pressure measurement devices and video equipment were lowered into Old Faithful . The probes were lowered as deep as 72 ft . Temperature measurements of the water at this depth was 244 F , the same as was measured in 1942 . The video probes were lowered to a maximum depth of 42 ft to observe the conduit formation and the processes that took place in the conduit . Some of the processes observed include fog formation from the interaction of cool air from above mixing with heated air from below , the recharge processes of water entering into the conduit and expanding from below , and entry of superheated steam measuring as high as 265 F into the conduit . \n \n Gallery",

Torosay is surrounded by 12 acre of spectacular gardens including formal terraces laid out at the turn of the 20th century and attributed to Sir Robert Lorimer . The castle and gardens used to be open to the public , being linked to the Craignure ferry terminal by the Isle of Mull Railway . \n \n The garden 's Statue Walk is made up of 19 statues in the style of Italian sculptor Antonio Bonazza . The statues were acquired by then-owner Walter Murray Guthrie from a derelict garden near Milan and shipped to Scotland for next to nothing as ballast in a cargo ship . \n \n John Campbell of Possil sold the castle and the estate to Arburthnot Charles Guthrie , a wealthy London businessman , in 1865 . It served as his `` getaway '' ; the castle has over 60 rooms and is surrounded by an estate of over 12 acre . Following the sale of Guthrie Castle out of the Guthrie family , Torosay was generally acknowledged as the seat for Clan Guthrie . Torosay was sold in 2012 to the McLean Fund and closed for renovations , and opened in December of 2013 with a private family . Christopher Guthrie-James , former Laird of the Estate said `` it was with a sense of relief , rather than regret , that we sold the family home at Torosay . '' Kenneth Donald McLean sixth Laird has spent more than £1 million renovating the castle and gardens . The castle and its gardens were closed to the public in the summer . \n \n The novelist Angela du Maurier , older sister of Dame Daphne du Maurier , is said to have spent some time residing at Torosay with her close companion Olive Guthrie ( great grandmother of the present owner ) . Angela dedicated her book Weep No More ( 1940 ) to `` Olive Guthrie of Torosay . '' Other visitors during the 1930s included Winston Churchill ( Olive Guthrie was his aunt by marriage ) and King George of Greece . \n \n Champagne find \n \n In July 2008 the then oldest bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne was discovered inside a sideboard in Torosay Castle . The 1893 bottle was in mint condition . It is believed to have been locked inside the dark sideboard since at least 1897 . The champagne is now on display at the Veuve Clicquot visitor centre in Reims , France , and regarded as `` priceless '' . \n \n Notes",

Cassiterite has been the chief tin ore throughout ancient history and remains the most important source of tin today . \n \n Occurrence \n \n Most sources of cassiterite today are found in alluvial or placer deposits containing the resistant weathered grains . The best sources of primary cassiterite are found in the tin mines of Bolivia , where it is found in hydrothermal veins . Rwanda has a nascent cassiterite mining industry . Fighting over cassiterite deposits ( particularly in Walikale ) is a major cause of the conflict waged in eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . This has led to cassiterite being considered a conflict mineral . \n \n Cassiterite is a widespread minor constituent of igneous rocks . The Bolivian veins and the old exhausted workings of Cornwall , England , are concentrated in high temperature quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives . The veins commonly contain tourmaline , topaz , fluorite , apatite , wolframite , molybdenite , and arsenopyrite . The mineral occurs extensively in Cornwall as surface deposits on Bodmin Moor , for example , where there are extensive traces of an hydraulic mining method known as streaming . The current major tin production comes from placer or alluvial deposits in Malaysia , Thailand , Indonesia , the Maakhir region of Somalia , and Russia . Hydraulic mining methods are used to concentrate mined ore , a process which relies on the high specific gravity of the SnO2 ore , of about 7.0 . \n \n Crystallography \n \n Crystal twinning is common in cassiterite and most aggregate specimens show crystal twins . The typical twin is bent at a near-60-degree angle , forming an `` elbow twin '' . Botryoidal or reniform cassiterite is called wood tin . \n \n Cassiterite is also used as a gemstone and collector specimens when quality crystals are found . \n \n Etymology \n \n The name derives from the Greek kassiteros for `` tin '' ; or from the Phoenician word Cassiterid referring to the islands of Ireland and Britain , the ancient sources of tin ; or , as Roman Ghirshman ( 1954 ) suggests , from the region of the Kassites , an ancient people in west and central Iran .",

It measures 146 kilometers long and 106 kilometers wide and has an area of 10,389 square kilometers comparable to the size of The Big Island of Hawaii or slightly smaller than Connecticut . Geologists believe that Viti Levu has been submerged a number of times , and has been covered by lava and other volcanic materials . Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions account for the somewhat rugged terrain of the island , which is divided into roughly equal halves by a north-south mountain range . The eastern side of the island experiences heavy rainfall , while the western side is noticeably drier . Accordingly , sugar cane production thrives in the west , while a dairy industry is being built in the east . Fiji 's biggest cattle ranch , with 7000 head of cattle in its 70 square kilometres , is at Yaqara , halfway between Tavua and Rakiraki . The centre of the island is forested and includes the nation 's highest peak Mount Tomanivi ( otherwise Mount Victoria ) rising to 1,324 meters . The island is the only known home of one of the world 's largest insects , the Giant Fijian long-horned beetle . \n \n Localities \n \n Viti Levu hosts the capital city of Suva , and is home to nearly three quarters of the population of the Republic ( about 580,000 ) . Other important towns , all around the coast , include Ba , Lautoka , Nadi , Nausori , Rakiraki , and Sigatoka . One major road has been built around the perimeter of Viti Levu . Well-known localities include Natadola Beach , Pacific Harbour ( a resort center about 50 kilometers from Suva ) . \n \n Politics \n \n Eight of Fiji 's fourteen Provinces are in Viti Levu . The Provinces of Ba , Nadroga-Navosa , and Ra comprise the Western Division , while Naitasiri , Namosi , Rewa , Serua , and Tailevu form the Central Division . In part because of its high concentration of Indo-Fijians , whose ancestors came mostly as indentured workers from India between 1879 and 1916 , the political dynamics of western Viti Levu are somewhat different from those of eastern Viti Levu , where , apart from the multi-racial urban areas , indigenous Fijians are more heavily concentrated . \n \n History \n \n Viti Levu is believed to have been inhabited longer than the northern island of Vanua Levu . According to oral traditions , the first Melanesian settlers landed at Vuda Point and established Viseisei , believed to be Fiji 's oldest settlement , although archaeologists refute this claim . \n \n Other \n \n The Canadian entrepreneur Peter Munk named his Klosters house after the island , as Viti Levu was where he and David Gilmour started the Southern Pacific Hotel chain in the 1960s .",

T.H.E . Fox was published on CompuServe , Q-Link and GEnie , and later on the Web as Thaddeus . Despite running weekly for several years , the comic never achieved Ekaitis ' goal of print syndication . Updates became less frequent , and eventually stopped altogether . \n \n Production \n \n Initial strips—consisting of one panel each—were drawn as pixel art on a C64 KoalaPad , first using KoalaPainter , then Advanced OCP Art Studio . Each panel had a resolution of 160x200 in sixteen colors ( or 320x200 in eight ) , and took from two hours to half a day to complete . Later strips were inked , then scanned onto a PC and touched up with Paintbrush . Characters were typically presented in a single plane , though some strips used oblique or perspective projection . \n \n Characters and themes \n \n The comic consisted almost entirely of gags ; some concerned the characters ' animal natures , but Ekaitis preferred to cover news and exaggerate events of everyday life.Ekatis : `` Since Thad and Bunn are more like people who happen to look like a fox and a rabbit , the gags seem to be funnier if their animal species do n't enter into it . Everyday life is the best source for gags . '' The main character—Thaddeus Horatio Eberhard , or simply Thaddeus Fox—was often seen interacting with his roommate , Bunnington Ellsworth Rabbit ( Bunn E. Rabbit ) . Other regulars included Grizz Lee , M.D . ; Wilt the Wolf ; an unnamed coyote , and Thaddaeus ' nephew , Ferdinand . \n \n Other appearances \n \n Thaddeus ( in fursuit form ) and his creator appeared on the Rapid T. Rabbit and Friends show several times and the cable TV show carried most episodes of the comic strip for a number of years . Thaddeus also appeared with Rapid T. Rabbit in the Pasadena Doo Dah Parade . The comic was mentioned in the magazines .info and RUN , and was the subject of an interview by the Commodore 64/128 RoundTable .

The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Texas Legislature , and to convene the legislature . The governor may grant pardons in cases other than impeachment ( but only when recommended by the Board of Pardons and Paroles ) or in the case of treason , with permission by the legislature . The current Governor is Greg Abbott . \n \n Compared to the governors of other U.S. states , the governorship of Texas is a fairly weak office . The Lieutenant Governor of Texas , who presides over the state Senate , is considered a more powerful political figure , being able to exercise greater personal prerogatives . \n \n The state 's first constitution in 1845 established the office of governor , to serve for two years , but no more than four years out of every six ( essentially a limit of no more than two consecutive terms ) . The 1861 secessionist constitution set the term start date at the first Monday in the November following the election . The 1866 constitution , adopted just after the American Civil War , increased terms to 4 years , but no more than 8 years out of every 12 , and moved the start date to the first Thursday after the organization of the legislature , or `` as soon thereafter as practicable '' . The Reconstruction constitution of 1869 removed the limit on terms , and to this day , Texas is one of 14 states with no gubernatorial term limit . The present constitution of 1876 shortened terms back to two years , but a 1972 amendment increased it again to four years . \n \n The gubernatorial election is held every four years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November and does not coincide with the presidential elections . The governor is sworn in on the third Tuesday of January every four years along with the lieutenant governor , so Abbott and current Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick both took office on January 20 , 2015 . \n \n Despite the lack of term limits , no Texas governor in the 19th or 20th centuries ever served more than seven and a half consecutive years in office ( Allan Shivers ) or eight years total service ( Bill Clements , in two non-consecutive four-year terms ) . Former Governor Rick Perry , who served from 2000 to 2015 , has now surpassed both these records , becoming the first Texas governor to serve three consecutive terms . When Perry won the general election on November 2 , 2010 , he joined Shivers , Price Daniel , and John Connally as the only Texas governors elected to three terms . In case of a vacancy in the office of governor , the lieutenant governor becomes governor . This rule was added only in a 1999 amendment , prior to which the lieutenant governor only acted as governor , except during the time of the 1861 constitution , which said that the lieutenant governor would be styled `` Governor of the State of Texas '' in case of vacancy .",

Bennett originally recorded the song in 1965 , and had a number 34 hit with it on the U.S. pop singles charts . Bennett , with Celine Dion , returned to the song on his Grammy-winning 2006 album Duets : An American Classic . \n \n Andy Hallett – the actor best known for playing the part of Lorne ( 'The Host ' ) in the television series Angel – sang a cover version of the song in that series ' final episode . The politician-spoofing BBC panel show If I Ruled the World was named after the song . \n \n This song was featured in Spring/Summer 2009 on the Vodafone adverts in the UK . \n \n Jamie Cullum also recorded a version for his album The Pursuit , and performed it at his special performance at the Late Night Prom , number Prom 55 , of The Proms in London , with The Heritage Ensemble , on Thursday 26 August 2010 between 22:15 and 13.45 .

Unlike the inner core , the outer core is not a solid . \n \n Properties \n \n The temperature of the outer core ranges from approximately 4300 K in the outer regions to 6000 K near the inner core . Evidence for a fluid outer core includes observations from seismology which shows that seismic shear-waves are not transmitted through that part of the Earth . Because of its high temperature , modeling work has shown that the outer core is a low viscosity fluid that convects turbulently . Eddy currents in the nickel iron fluid of the outer core are believed to influence the Earth 's magnetic field . The average magnetic field strength in the Earth 's outer core was measured to be 2.5 millitesla , 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface . The outer core is not under enough pressure to be solid , so it is liquid even though it has a composition similar to that of the inner core . Sulfur and oxygen could also be present in the outer core . \n \n As heat is transferred outward toward the mantle , the net trend is for the inner boundary of the liquid region to freeze , causing the solid inner core to grow . This growth rate is estimated to be 1 mm per year .",

The theater was a stone building owned by the Venetian Tron family , and took its name from the neighbourhood where it was located , the parish of San Cassiano near the Rialto . It was considered 'public ' as it was directed by an impresario , or general manager , for the paying public rather than for nobles exclusively . \n \n History \n \n The original theater , for spoken plays , was built by Andrea Palladio in 1565 . His wooden structure succumbed to fire in 1629 . This was soon after replaced by a stone building , which was acquired by the Tron family . At this point all the theatres of Venice , such as the Teatro San Salvatore of the Vendramin family , were aristocratic private theatres , not commercial . \n \n The first operas of the commercially run venture were L'Andromeda and La Maga Fulminata . These were produced in 1637 and 1638 respectively , by Romans Benedetto Ferrari and Francesco Manelli . Ferrari and company stayed until 1639 when the business was acquired by a new company managed by entrepreneur Francesco Caletti-Bruni , with financial backing from Venetian nobleman Cavalli . Caletti-Bruni composed most of the operas performed here in the six years from 1639 to 1645 . After the 1650s the theater was surpassed by others , and its number of performances declined . Impresario Marco Faustini managed the Teatro San Cassiano from 1657 to 1660 . \n \n Towards the end of the 17th century , Venice became the opera capital of the world as another ten opera houses had opened . At this point the Teatro San Cassiano could count first performances of 37 operas . The last performances were held in 1807 and it was demolished in 1812 , mainly due to recurring fires . The operatic period dramma in musica coincided with the early years of the commercial San Cassiano and was influenced by its composers .",

The 90 kn definition is very non-standard . A common alternative definition of the maximum is 55 knots ( 55 kn , 55 kn ) . \n \n The most common way of measuring winds is with the Beaufort scale , which defines a gale as wind from 50 to 102 km/h . It is an empirical measure for describing wind speed based mainly on observed sea conditions . Its full name is the Beaufort Wind Force Scale . \n \n On the Beaufort Wind Scale , a gale is classified as : 7 : Moderate Gale ( 32–38 miles per hour ) , 8 : Fresh Gale ( 39-46 mph ) , 9 : Strong Gale ( 47-54 mph ) and 10 : Storm/Whole Gale ( 55-63 mph ) .

It is run at Newmarket over a distance of 2 miles and 2 furlongs ( 3,621 metres ) , and finishes on the Rowley Mile . It is scheduled to take place each year in October . \n \n History \n \n `` Cesarewitch '' is an anglicised version of Tsesarevich , the title of the heir to the throne in Imperial Russia . The race was named in honour of Tsesarevich Alexander ( later Tsar Alexander II ) , after he donated £300 to the Jockey Club . \n \n The event was established in 1839 , and the inaugural running was won by Cruiskeen . It was founded in the same year as another major handicap at Newmarket , the Cambridgeshire . The two races came to be known as the Autumn Double . \n \n The Cesarewitch initially took place before the Cambridgeshire , but the schedule was later reversed and it is now held two weeks after the other race . Three horses completed the double in the 19th century — Rosebery ( 1876 ) , Foxhall ( 1881 ) and Plaisanterie ( 1885 ) — but the feat has been rarely attempted since then . \n \n The race was formerly staged during Newmarket 's Champions ' Day meeting in mid-October and became part of a new fixture called Future Champions Day in 2011 . In 2014 the Cesarewitch was separated from Future Champions Day , which was moved back a week in the calendar , and in 2015 it returned to the Saturday of the new Future Champions Festival . \n \n Records \n \n Most successful horse ( 2 wins ) : \n * Aaim To Prosper - 2010 , 2012 \n \n Leading jockey ( 6 wins ) : \n * Doug Smith – Canatrice ( 1939 ) , French Design ( 1954 ) , Sandiacre ( 1957 ) , Come to Daddy ( 1959 ) , Alcove ( 1960 ) , Persian Lancer ( 1966 ) \n \n Leading trainer ( 4 wins ) : \n * William Day – Haco ( 1853 ) , Dulcibella ( 1860 ) , Thalestris ( 1864 ) , Foxhall ( 1881 ) \n * Mathew Dawson – Lioness ( 1863 ) , Julius ( 1867 ) , Salvanos ( 1872 ) , Stone Clink ( 1886 ) \n \n Winners since 1974 \n \n * Weights given in stones and pounds . \n \n The 1986 and 1999 editions were held on Newmarket 's July Course over a slightly shorter distance . \n \n Earlier winners \n \n * 1839 : Cruiskeen \n * 1840 : Clarion \n * 1841 : Iliona \n * 1842 : Arcanus \n * 1843 : Corranna \n * 1844 : Faugh-a-Ballagh \n * 1845 : The Baron \n * 1846 : Wit 's End \n * 1847 : Caurouch \n * 1848 : The Cur \n * 1849 : Legerdemain \n * 1850 : Glauca \n * 1851 : Mrs Taft \n * 1852 : Weathergage \n * 1853 : Haco \n * 1854 : Muscovite \n * 1855 : Mr Sykes \n * 1856 : Vengeance \n * 1857 : Prioress 1 \n * 1858 : Rocket \n * 1859 : Artless \n * 1860 : Dulcibella \n * 1861 : Audrey \n * 1862 : Hartington \n * 1863 : Lioness \n * 1864 : Thalestris \n * 1865 : Salpinctes \n * 1866 : Lecturer \n * 1867 : Julius \n * 1868 : Cecil \n * 1869 : Cherie \n * 1870 : Cardinal York \n * 1871 : Corisande \n * 1872 : Salvanos \n * 1873 : King Lud \n * 1874 : Aventuriere \n * 1875 : Duke of Parma \n * 1876 : Rosebery \n * 1877 : Hilarious \n * 1878 : Jester \n * 1879 : Chippendale \n * 1880 : Robert the Devil \n * 1881 : Foxhall \n * 1882 : Corrie Roy \n * 1883 : Don Juan \n * 1884 : St Gatien \n * 1885 : Plaisanterie \n * 1886 : Stone Clink \n * 1887 : Humewood \n * 1888 : Tenebreuse \n * 1889 : Primrose Day \n * 1890 : Sheen \n * 1891 : Ragimunde \n * 1892 : Burnaby \n * 1893 : Cypria / Red Eyes 2 \n * 1894 : Childwick \n * 1895 : Rockdove \n * 1896 : St Bris \n * 1897 : Merman \n * 1898 : Chaleureux \n * 1899 : Scintillant \n * 1900 : Clarehaven \n * 1901 : Balsarroch \n * 1902 :",

Gray was also known for his distinctive vocal impersonation of Elvis Presley . \n \n Early life and career \n \n Gray was born in Carshalton , Surrey , in 1946 . He was a self-taught musician , and during his school years , he played trumpet with a jazz band , and then , with a younger brother , went on to form the skiffle unit , The Mourners . After leaving school he worked for Pearl & Dean , writing commercials , and later for Moss Bros before finding success with Mud . \n \n With a few line-up changes , The Mourners evolved into Mud in February 1966 , with Gray on vocals , Dave Mount on drums , Rob Davis on guitar , and Ray Stiles on bass , and won the Search for Sound song contest the same year . After a few unsuccessful singles including `` Flower Power '' , they were signed to Mickie Most 's RAK record label , and gained television exposure via an appearance on The Basil Brush Show . They toured in support of Tom Jones in 1973 . Mud had a string of hits written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman , including two which topped the UK Singles Chart in 1974 , `` Lonely This Christmas '' , and `` Tiger Feet '' , and a chart topping cover of `` Oh , Boy ! '' ( originally performed by Buddy Holly ) . They disbanded in 1979 . \n \n Gray had a Top 40 solo hit ( # 32 ) in 1977 with his cover version of `` A Groovy Kind of Love .

Typically , it is produced by melting butter and allowing the components to separate by density . The water evaporates , some solids float to the surface and are skimmed off , and the remainder of the milk solids sink to the bottom and are left behind when the butter fat ( which would then be on top ) is poured off . \n \n Commercial methods of production also include direct evaporation , but may also be accomplished by decantation and centrifugation followed by vacuum drying ; or direct from cream by breaking the emulsion followed by centrifugation . \n \n Properties \n \n Clarified butter has a higher smoke point ( 485 °F or 252 °C ) than regular butter ( 325-375 °F or 163-190 °C ) , and is therefore preferred in some cooking applications , such as sautéing . Clarified butter also has a much longer shelf life than fresh butter . It has negligible amounts of lactose and casein and is , therefore , acceptable to most who have a lactose intolerance or milk allergy . \n \n Regional variations \n \n In South Asian cuisine and Arab cuisine , clarified butter ( ghee ) may be cooked long enough to evaporate the water portion and caramelize the milk solids ( which are then filtered out ) , resulting in a nutty flavor .",

They successfully hosted nine episodes and it attracted a lot of viewers . In 2007 , Gale and Munro 's show contracts expired , so Newton and Zemiro replaced them as presenters . However , it was cancelled by the Nine Network after coming last place in the nightly ratings on 6 August 2007 due to the big win for Channel Seven .. \n \n In a November issue of a TV Week magazine in 2007 , Munro claimed he and Gale left the show because the programmers wanted to lighten up the show and make it more fun .

The name comes from the area where the brewery relocated in 1850 . The company is owned by the Carlsberg Group . The main brand is Kronenbourg 1664 , a 5.5 % abv pale lager . \n \n History \n \n Geronimus Hatt , who obtained his Master Brewer 's certificate in 1649 , started up the Canon Brewery in the Place du Corbeau in Strasbourg . His son Claude ( born November 1665 ) , succeeded his father in the trade in 1683 . However , the frequent flooding of the River Ill compelled in 1850 a move to the higher terrain of Cronenbourg , an area of Strasbourg . \n \n In 1922 , the Hatt Brewery changed its name to Tigre Bock , the most well-known brand of the Tiger Brewery it had acquired to become the leading brewer in Alsace . Following the Second World War , Kronenbourg became the name of the company , and began international expansion . In 1970 , it was acquired by industrial group BSN ( now Groupe Danone ) , along with the Société Européenne de Brasseries ( Kanterbräu ) . In 1986 , Kronenbourg merged with Kanterbräu . \n \n In 1952 , the 1664 is commercialised in honour of the coronation of Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II . \n \n British company Scottish and Newcastle ( S & N ) plc acquired it in 2000 for £1.7 billion . In April , 2008 , S & N 's operations were sold to Heineken and Carlsberg , the latter acquiring Kronenbourg . \n \n Its main breweries are in Obernai and in Champigneulles , although the Champigneulles site is now up for sale . \n \n On 2 April 2015 , Brasseries Kronenbourg launched a new corporate identity which it will use in corporate communications . It was designed by Carré Noir , which has been the brewery 's design agency for several years . According to a press release , the new logo reaffirms Kronenbourg 's identity as a French brewer with 350 years of history . \n \n Beers \n \n Kronenbourg 1664 is a 5.0 % pale lager first brewed in 1952 . A small amount of the Strisselspalt hop , a French aroma hop from Alsace , is used . The main Kronenbourg 1664 brewery ( where Kronenbourg also produces almost 300 other beer brands ) is in Obernai ( France ) , but the brand is also brewed in the UK by Heineken at its Manchester brewery , as well as in Australia by Coopers . \n \n Other brands include : 1664 Brune ; Single Malt ( French name Malt d'Exception ) , 6.1 % abv ; Kronenbourg Blanc , a fruity white beer with citrus notes ; Kronenbourg Premier Cru 6.0 % abv ; Kronenbourg Cold Premier 5.0 % , a super chilled variant on 1664 , draught only , UK ; and Kronenbourg Red 4.2 % abv .",

'' It is also known as the `` Mount Pipe '' ( JPN : パイプ山 , paipu-yama ) , since the sulfur gas and water vapor that rolls in from the summit , alongside the rest of the island , give the appearance of a smoking pipe when viewed from the sea . \n \n Joe Rosenthal 's famous photograph Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima was taken at the mountain 's peak . \n \n Geology \n \n Geologically , the mountain is a cinder cone of andesite , formed by volcanic activity . It is thought that the mountain is a dormant vent to a still active volcano ( designated Iō-tō , the name of the island as a whole ) . From 1889 to 1957 , the Japanese government recorded 16 eruptions on the peak . One eruption lasted for 65 minutes , and created a crater with a diameter of 35 meters and a depth of 15 meters on the runway near the former World War II airfield . Most recently , the Japanese Meteorological Agency reported that on May 2 , 2012 , a small eruption caused water discoloration to the northeast , and confirmed the appearance of a new fumarole . \n \n History \n \n During World War II , the Japanese built underground tunnel and bunker systems in and on Mount Suribachi . In the spring of 1945 , United States Marines invaded the island and initiated a major battle . For the United States , Iwo Jima was an important strategic point between the United States and mainland Japan , a status that resulted in severe fighting that took the lives of nearly 7,000 Americans and 20,000 Japanese . \n \n The film Sands of Iwo Jima , directed by Allan Dwan and starring John Wayne in 1949 , follows a United States Marine squad preparing for battle at Iwo Jima . The films Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers , directed by Clint Eastwood in 2006 , treat the theme of this Pacific battle and present the positions of both belligerents in this conflict .",

The many fruits formed in each inflorescence have long silky appendages which , seen together , give the characteristic appearance of Old Man 's beard . The grooves along the stems of C. vitalba can easily be felt when handling the plant . \n \n This species is eaten by the larvae of a wide range of moths . This includes many species which are reliant on it as their sole foodplant ; including Small Emerald , Small Waved Umber and Haworth 's Pug . \n \n Range \n \n C. vitalba has a preference for base rich alkaline soils and moist climate with warm summers . \n \n United Kingdom \n \n In the UK it is a native plant and is common throughout England south of a line from the River Mersey and the River Humber . It also commonly occurs in southern , Eastern and northern Wales . Outside of these areas it is widely planted and occurs as far north as the southern highlands of Scotland . \n \n Characteristics \n \n * Reproductive organs : \n * * Inflorescence type : biparous cyme \n * * Sex : hermaphrodite \n * * Type of pollination : entomophilous \n * Seed : \n * * Type of fruit : achene \n * * Dissemination : With the wind \n * Habitat and distribution : \n * * Type of habitat : Mid-European shrubberies , mountainsides , in moderately eutrophic regions \n * * Distribution : Holarctic \n \n Invasiveness \n \n Due to its disseminatory reproductive system , vitality , and climbing behavior , Clematis vitalba is an invasive plant in most places , including many in which it is native . Some new tree plantations can be suffocated by a thick layer of Clematis vitalba , if not checked . \n \n ; New Zealand \n \n In New Zealand it is declared an `` unwanted organism '' and is listed in the National Pest Plant Accord . It can not be sold , propagated or distributed . It is a potential threat to native plants since it grows vigorously and forms a canopy which smothers all other plants and has no natural controlling organisms in New Zealand . New Zealand native species of Clematis have smooth stems and can easily be differentiated from C. vitalba by touch . \n \n Use \n \n Clematis vitalba was used to make rope during the Stone Age in Switzerland . In Slovenia , the stems of the plant were used for weaving baskets for onions and also for binding crops . It was particularly useful for binding sheaves of grain because mice do not gnaw on it . It is also widely considered in the medical community to be an effective cure for stress and nerves . \n \n Images",

It is inhabited by a few Afar , who engage in salt mining . Local geology is characterized by volcanic and tectonic activity , various climate cycles , and discontinuous erosion . The Danakil Desert has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys . Among these is Lake Afrera , which has thick saline crusts on its banks . The area is flanked toward the east by the Dancal Alps , a tabular mountain system that has a few volcanic cones which peak in height in Mount Ramlo ( ) . A plinth of salt up to 800 m thick can also be found in the Salt Plain flatlands . Other local lakes include Lake Asale ( 116 m below sea level ) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera ( 80 m below sea level ) , both of which possess cryptodepressions in the Danakil Depression . The Afrera contains many active volcanoes , including the Maraho , Dabbahu , Afdera and Erta Ale . The Afar people mine for a day more until the camels are fully loaded with the salt tiles .

This is the kiss of Judas , also known ( especially in art ) as the Betrayal of Christ , which occurs in the Garden of Gethsemane after the Last Supper , and leads directly to the arrest of Jesus by the police force of the Sanhedrin ( Kilgallen 271 ) . \n \n More broadly , a Judas kiss may refer to `` an act appearing to be an act of friendship , which is in fact harmful to the recipient . '' \n \n In the New Testament \n \n Both Matthew ( 26:47–50 ) and Mark ( 14:43–45 ) use the Greek verb kataphilein , which means to kiss firmly , intensely , passionately , tenderly , or warmly . It is the same verb that Plutarch uses to describe a famous kiss that Alexander the Great gave Bagoas . According to Matthew , Jesus responded by saying : `` Friend , do what you are here to do . '' This has caused speculation that Jesus and Judas were actually in agreement with each other and that there was no real betrayal.Pagels , Elaine at Karen L.

During a sound check before the address , Reagan made the following joke to the radio technicians : `` My fellow Americans , I 'm pleased to tell you today that I 've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever . We begin bombing in five minutes . '' The joke was a parody of the opening line of that day 's speech : `` My fellow Americans , I 'm pleased to tell you that today I signed legislation that will allow student religious groups to begin enjoying a right they 've too long been denied — the freedom to meet in public high schools during nonschool hours , just as other student groups are allowed to do . '' \n \n Contrary to popular misconception , this microphone gaffe was not broadcast over the air , but rather leaked later to the general populace . But the Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported in October 1984 that the Soviet Far East Army was placed on alert after word of the statement got out and that the alert was not withdrawn until 30 minutes later . An unnamed aide to US Representative Michael Barnes ( D-Md . ) confirmed that the Pentagon was aware of the alert . There was no report of any change in the DEFCON level for the United States . The Soviet reaction , and mild confusion it created , was covered by NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw . \n \n This was not the first time Reagan had joked before giving a speech or address . The Soviet official news agency , TASS , condemned the joke , declaring that `` The USSR condemns this unprecedented and hostile attack by the US President '' and that `` this kind of behavior is incompatible with the great responsibility borne by heads of nuclear states for the destinies of their own people and mankind '' . \n \n The quip became the basis for a song titled `` Five Minutes '' , as well as `` A is for Atom ( B is for Bomb ) '' by Monte Cazazza 's band The Atom Smashers , both of which began with a clip of the recording .",

This satire of self-help style guides manipulates traditional British conventions for the gamester , all life being a game , who understands that if you 're not one-up , you 're one-down . Potter 's unprincipled principles apply to almost any possession , experience or situation , deriving maximum undeserved rewards and discomforting the opposition . The 1960 film School for Scoundrels and the 2006 film School For Scoundrels were satiric portrayals of how to use Potter 's ideas . \n \n In that context , the term refers to a satiric course in the gambits required for the systematic and conscious practice of `` creative intimidation '' , making one 's associates feel inferior and thereby gaining the status of being `` one-up '' on them .

          "context": "`` My Funny Valentine '' is a show tune from the 1937 Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart musical Babes in Arms in which it was introduced by former child star Mitzi Green . The song became a popular jazz standard , appearing on over 1300 albums performed by over 600 artists , including Chet Baker , Bill Evans , Duke Ellington , Billy Eckstine , Frank Sinatra , Sarah Vaughan , Ella Fitzgerald , Andy Williams , Shirley Bassey , Miles Davis , Etta James , Harry James , Nico , Chaka Khan , Elvis Costello , Melanie C , and Rickie Lee Jones . In 2015 it was announced that the Gerry Mulligan quartet featuring Chet Baker 's version of the song was inducted into the Library of Congress 's National Recording Registry for the song 's `` cultural , artistic and/or historical significance to American society and the nation ’ s audio legacy '' . \n \n Structure \n \n The song is usually performed in C Minor , although for vocalists the key of B Minor is fairly common . Frank Sinatra recorded the song in B Minor , and the theatrical version was also in B Minor . Ella Fitzgerald recorded the song in G Minor . \n \n The song follows the following chord progression ( in the key of C Minor ) : \n \n * C- , C-maj7 , C-7 , C-6 , Amaj7 , F-7 , D-7 ( 5 ) , G7 ( 9 ) \n * ditto through to the F-7 , then D9 , B7 ( 9 ) \n * ( bridge ) Emaj7 , F-7 , G-7 , F-7 , Emaj7 , F-7 , G-7 , F-7 , Emaj7 , G7 ( 5 ) , C- , ( B7 , A7 ) Amaj7 , D-7 ( 5 ) G7 , \n * C- , C-maj7 , C-7 , C-6 , Amaj7 , D-7 ( 5 ) G7 ( 9 ) , C- , B-7 A7 , Amaj7 , F-7 , B7 ( 9 ) , C-7 ( preferred , or Emaj7 ) \n \n This simple and classic structure makes it easy to adapt to other genres and for jazz musicians to improvise over the established chords . \n \n History \n \n Babes in Arms opened at the Shubert Theatre on Broadway , in New York City on April 14 , 1937 and ran for 289 performances . In the original play , a character named Billie Smith ( played by Mitzi Green ) sings the song to Valentine `` Val '' LaMar ( played by Ray Heatherton ) . In the song , Billie pokes fun at some of Valentine 's characteristics , but ultimately affirms that he makes her smile and that she does n't want him to change ( the song is often sung by a man to a woman , though to say that a woman 's looks are `` laughable '' is anomalous , and perhaps dangerous ) . The song first hit the charts in 1945 , performed by Hal McIntyre with vocals by Ruth Gaylor . It only appeared for one week and hit # 16 . In the 1955 romantic musical comedy film , Gentlemen Marry Brunettes , it was sung by Jeanne Crain ( dubbed by Anita Ellis ) and Alan Young , and in 1957 was sung by Kim Novak in the film Pal Joey . \n \n The song is part of the Great American Songbook and has had many notable recordings ( see talk page ) .",

He was also a member of the Astor family . \n \n Background and education \n \n William was the eldest son of Waldorf Astor and Nancy Witcher Langhorne . He was educated at Eton and at New College , Oxford . \n \n Political career \n \n In 1932 , Astor was appointed secretary to Victor Bulwer-Lytton , 2nd Earl of Lytton , League of Nations Committee of Enquiry in what was then known as Manchuria . First elected to the House of Commons in 1935 , he served as a Conservative Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Fulham East until 1945 . Between 1936 and 1937 he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Samuel Hoare , who was then made Secretary of State for the Home Department in the new cabinet of Neville Chamberlain in 1937 . \n \n Astor left parliament for a time , but returned as the Conservative MP for Wycombe in the 1951 general election , serving for ten months . On his father 's death in 1952 , he inherited his title , becoming the 3rd Viscount Astor . Astor took his seat in the House of Lords , forcing a by-election in Wycombe , which was won by the Conservative candidate John Hall . During the 1963 Profumo Affair Astor was accused of having an affair with Mandy Rice-Davies . In response to being told during one of the trials arising out of the scandal that Astor had denied having an affair with her , Rice-Davies famously replied `` He would , would n't he ? '' \n \n Astor then took over the family 's Cliveden estate in Buckinghamshire , where he and his family continued to live until 1966 . Active in thoroughbred horse racing , he inherited Cliveden Stud , a horse farm and breeding operation in the village of Taplow near Maidenhead . \n \n Marriages and children \n \n Viscount Astor married three times : \n \n Firstly , on 14 June 1945 he married Hon Sarah Kathleen Elinor Norton ( born 20 January 1920 , died 4 February 2013 ) , daughter of Richard Henry Brinsley Norton , 6th Baron Grantley .

They had one daughter before divorce in 1960 : \n \n * Hon Emily Mary Astor ( born 9 June 1956 ) \n \n Finally , on 14 October 1960 Astor married Janet Bronwen Alun Pugh ( born 6 June 1930 ) . They had two daughters : \n \n * Hon Janet Elizabeth Astor ( born 1 December 1961 ) , second wife of Charles Gordon-Lennox , Earl of March and Kinrara \n * Hon Pauline Marian Astor ( born 26 March 1964 ) \n \n Astor died in Nassau , Bahamas , at age 58 from a heart attack and was buried in the Octagon Temple at Cliveden .

The films starred Australian singer Barry Crocker as McKenzie , and chronicled the character 's adventures in Britain and France respectively . In the films , McKenzie is the nephew of another of Humphries ' characters , Edna Everage . Despite the banning of The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie in Australia , the films received considerable support from the Australian government of John Gorton , becoming the first to receive funding from the Australian Film Development Commission . Later Prime Minister Gough Whitlam even made an appearance in Barry McKenzie Holds His Own , where he granted a damehood to McKenzie 's aunt , Edna Everage . \n \n Character \n \n The character was a parody of the boorish Australian overseas , particularly those residing in Britain – ignorant , loud , crude , drunk and punchy – although McKenzie also proved popular with Australians because he embodied some of their positive characteristics : he was friendly , forthright and straightforward with his British hosts , who themselves were often portrayed as stereotypes of pompous , arrogant , devious colonialists . \n \n McKenzie frequently employs euphemisms for bodily functions or sexual allusions , one of the most well-known being `` technicolour yawn '' ( vomiting ) . The film popularised several Australian euphemisms and slang terms which are still used today in the Australian vernacular ( such as `` point Percy at the porcelain '' , `` sink the sausage '' and `` flash the nasty '' ) . Some of the sayings were invented by Humphries , while other terms were borrowed from existing Australian slang such as `` chunder '' and `` up shit creek '' ( adopted by the Australian poetry magazine Shit Creek Review ) . \n \n Men at Work lead singer Colin Hay said that the lyrics for `` Down Under '' were inspired by the Barry McKenzie character .",

The broken shards of metal from the wings and fuselages resemble a seascape of jagged ice , possibly inspired by Caspar David Friedrich 's The Sea of Ice . It measures . and has been in the collection of the Tate Gallery since 1946 . \n \n Background \n \n Nash was an official war artist in the First and Second World Wars . In 1940 , he was asked to work for the Air Ministry , and Nash started work on Totes Meer that year . Some representatives of the Air Ministry disliked his style of art , and his full-time position was terminated before the end of the year . Totes Meer was completed in 1941 , and offered to the War Artists ' Advisory Committee in 1941 . Nash was paid £150 for the painting . \n \n Description \n \n The work was based on sketches and photographs made at the Metal and Produce Recovery Unit at Cowley near Oxford in August 1940 , where the remains of both German and British crashed aircraft were brought to be recycled at the Morris Motors car factory nearby , which being used to construct and repair aircraft . Nash wrote that , under moonlight , the sea of wreckage could be perceived to move and twist , but in reality it was of course dead , and the only movement was the flight of a white owl , depicted to the upper right . \n \n The desolate landscape harkens back to the paintings that Nash made as a war artist in the First World War , such as We Are Making a New World or The Menin Road . The mournful tone may also have been influenced by his personal circumstances : an affair with painter Eileen Agar was coming to an end , and Nash was suffering from a respiratory illness which ultimately caused his death . \n \n Nash initially called the work Iron Sea , but he hoped that the work could be reproduced on postcards to be sent to Germany as propaganda and decided on a German title instead . \n \n Reception \n \n Kenneth Clark , chairman of the War Artists ' Advisory Committee , described Totes Meer as `` the best war picture so far '' and the painting was an immediate success when it was displayed in an exhibition of National War Pictures at the National Gallery in May 1941 . It was presented to the Tate Gallery in 1946 and is considered to be one of the most important British paintings of the Second World War .",

A whole note and a whole rest . \n \n In music , a whole note ( American ) or semibreve ( British ) is a note represented by a hollow oval note head , like a half note ( or minim ) , and no note stem ( see Figure 1 ) . Its length is equal to four beats in 4/4 time , that is the whole 4/4 measure ( or bar ) . Most other notes are fractions of the whole note ; half notes are played for one half the duration of the whole note , quarter notes ( or crotchets ) are each played for one quarter the duration , etc . \n \n A whole note lasts half as long as a double whole note ( or breve—hence the British name , semibreve ) , and twice as long as a half note , or minim . The symbol is first found in music notation from the late thirteenth century . \n \n A related symbol is the whole rest ( or semibreve rest ) , which usually denotes a silence for the same duration . Whole rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles generally hanging under the second line from the top of a musical staff , though they may occasionally be put under a different line in more complicated passages , such as when two instruments or vocalists are written on one staff , and one is temporarily silent . \n \n Other lengths \n \n The whole note and whole rest may also be used in music of free rhythm , such as Anglican chant , to denote a whole measure , irrespective of the time of that measure . The whole rest can be used this way in almost all or all forms of music . \n \n Etymology \n \n The whole note derives from the semibrevis of mensural notation , and this is the origin of the British name . The American name is a calque of the German ganze Note . \n \n The names of this note ( and rest ) in different languages vary greatly : \n \n The Catalan , French and Spanish names for the note ( meaning `` round '' ) derive from the fact that the semibrevis was distinguished by its round stemless shape , which is true as well of the modern form ( in contrast to the double whole note or shorter values with stems ) . The Greek name means `` whole '' . Chinese , Japanese , Korean , and Vietnamese names mean `` whole note '' .",

The cocktail is reputed to have been invented in 1952 by three-time world champion mixologist Donato `` Duke '' Antone , and named by Antone after a surfer frequenting Antone 's Blackwatch Bar in Los Angeles . However , recent research by culinary historians casts doubt on this theory . Robert Simonson goes so far as to say that `` no sane person ever believed that story . '' Simonson emphasizes the lack of a historical record for any Blackwatch Bar , and indicates that , in fact , Antone lived in Hartford , Connecticut , rather than Los Angeles during the relevant period . \n \n Other historians such as David Wondrich emphasize the role of McKesson Imports Company and its marketing team for developing the drink , confirming among other things that the company commissioned a graphic artist to develop a `` Harvey Wallbanger '' sandal-clad surfer mascot in the late 1960s . It is known that McKesson executive George Bednar was instrumental in promoting the drink as a means of selling its component Galliano liqueur , and Bednar claimed to have penned a popular tagline for the drink : `` Harvey Wallbanger is the name . And I can be made ! `` . \n \n Other uses \n \n * The 1982 Milwaukee Brewers , winners of the American League pennant , were nicknamed `` Harvey 's Wallbangers , '' because of the team 's power hitting ( wall banging ) under mid-season manager Harvey Kuenn . After a mediocre 23–24 start to the season , manager Buck Rodgers was fired . Under Kuenn , the team went 72–43 ( .626 ) , led the Major Leagues in home runs and total bases , and produced the highest team OPS+ since the New York Yankees . \n * The SAS sometimes referred to C4 explosive charges as `` Harvey Wall-bangers . '' \n * Harvey Wallbanger is sometimes used to refer to the Wall Follower maze solving algorithm . \n * Harvey Wallbanger was the puppet character who ran the `` dead-letter '' post office on the Canadian children 's show , The Hilarious House of Frightenstein . \n * Harvey Wallbanger was the drink ordered by a character on the train in the 2010 movie Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz . \n * The Movie See No Evil , Hear No Evil includes the lines : \n \n Do you like Harvey Wallbangers ? \n Harvey who ? \n Wallbangers , a friend of mine . \n I 'll introduce you later . \n * The character Sven , from Class of '77 , gets constantly drunk due to his love of Harvey Wallbangers . \n * In CB lingo , a Harvey Wallbanger is a drunk driver ; specifically , one who continually drifts across the road from one shoulder to the other and back .",

France ceded Louisiana to the United States by the treaty of Paris , of April 30 , 1803 . Spain made a cession of East and West Florida by the treaty of February 22 , 1819 . Cessions have been severally made of a part of their territory by New York , Virginia , Massachusetts , Connecticut , South Carolina , North Carolina , and Georgia . \n \n Civil law \n \n Under the civil law system , cession is the equivalent of assignment , and therefore , is an act by which a personal claim is transferred from the assignor ( the cedent ) to the assignee ( the cessionary ) . Whereas real rights are transferred by delivery , personal rights are transferred by cession . Once the obligation of the debtor is transferred , the cessionary is entirely substituted . The original creditor ( cedent ) loses his right to claim and the new creditor ( cessionary ) gains that right . \n \n Ecclesiastical law \n \n When an ecclesiastic is created bishop , or when a parson or rector takes another benefice without dispensation , the first benefice becomes void by a legal cession , or surrender .",

          "context": "Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha is a novel by Irish writer Roddy Doyle , first published in 1993 by Secker and Warburg . It won the Booker Prize that year . The story is about a 10-year-old boy living in Barrytown , North Dublin , and the events that happen within his age group , school and home in around 1968 . \n \n Language and plot structure \n \n The novel is known for its interesting use of language – Doyle uses a register that gives the reader the vivid impression of listening to a ten-year-old Irish boy from the 1960s . The novel is not divided into chapters but into small scenes which do not follow any chronological order . \n \n The plot structure of the novel is also unconventional , that of numerous vignettes . Despite the absence of a clear-cut plot ( introduction , complication , climax , dénouement ) one can still , with certain sensitivities in place , derive a perceptible passing of time as we witness , gradually , how Barrytown changes . \n \n The novel , chronicling Paddy 's internal journey towards maturity , is a bildungsroman as it centres around the main character 's development . Paddy 's growing up is painfully bitter . While the beginning of the book is filled with playful antics , the growing antagonism between his parents and the breaking up of their marriage are evident as the novel moves on . What makes Paddy 's rite of passage , as it were , all the more tragic is the fact that he does not choose his `` journey of enlightenment and maturity '' , rather , he is robbed of it when his parents become estranged from one another . \n \n Plot synopsis \n \n Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha recounts ( approximately ) one year in the life of a Dublin ten-year-old , Patrick `` Paddy '' Clarke , especially his relationships with Sinbad ( Francis ) , his younger brother , his parents and his schoolmates and teachers . It begins with him being a mischievous boy roaming around local Barrytown and ends with his father departing from the family , forcing the boy to take up adult responsibilities in his now single-parent home .",

In the show , Anna sings the song as she strikes up a warm and affectionate relationship with the children and the wives of the King of Siam . \n \n This song is one of the cases during the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership when Rodgers re-used a melody he had written for an earlier show and then discarded . In this case the melody was a tune he wrote for South Pacific , called `` Suddenly Hungry and Sad '' , which he originally intended for the character of Nellie to sing but replaced it with the song `` ( I 'm in Love with ) a Random Guy '' . Mary Martin , the star of South Pacific , who had proposed that Rodgers should cast Yul Brynner as the King , reminded Rodgers of this tune , and so Hammerstein wrote new lyrics to it . James Taylor covered the song off of the children 's music compilation called For Our Children . \n \n Popular versions on record include James Taylor , Dinah Shore , Sharon , Lois & Bram , Bing Crosby , Andy Williams , and Nancy Wilson . Leon Redbone sang the song in ads for the Chevrolet Geo . A version by NRBQ is included on their album Brass Tacks . \n \n In 2015 , the song was used as a closing credits theme for Season 3 of the Netflix original series Orange Is the New Black . Recently TransUnion has begun employing the song in its commercials promoting the company 's credit monitoring service . \n \n The song is featured in a scene in a film by the character J. O.

While it is stated that they were twin brothers , that has not been positively proved . [ http : //www.newadvent.org/cathen/04491a.htm Meier , Gabriel . `` Sts . Crispin and Crispinian . '' The Catholic Encyclopedia . Vol . 4 . New York : Robert Appleton Company , 1908 . 14 Mar . 2015 ] \n \n They earned enough by their trade to support themselves and also to aid the poor . Their success attracted the ire of Rictus Varus , governor of Belgic Gaul , who had them tortured and thrown into the river with millstones around their necks . Though they survived , they were beheaded by the Emperor c. 286 . \n \n An alternative account gives them to be sons of a noble Romano-Briton family who lived in Canterbury , following their father 's murder for displeasing the Roman Emperor . As they were approaching maturity their mother sent them to London to seek apprenticeship and to avoid coming to the attention of their father 's killer . Travelling there , the brothers came across a shoemaker 's workshop at Faversham and decided to travel no further and stayed in Faversham . This account fails to explain how the brothers came to be venerated and martyred . \n \n Veneration \n \n The feast day of Saints Crispin and Crispinian is 25 October . Although this feast was removed from the Roman Catholic Church 's universal liturgical calendar following the Second Vatican Council , the two saints are still commemorated on that day in the most recent edition of the Roman Church 's martyrology . \n \n In the sixth century a stately basilica was erected at Soissons over the graves of these saints , and St. Eligius , a famous goldsmith , made a costly shrine for the head of St. Crispinian . \n \n Popular culture \n \n Saint Crispin is often associated with the Battle of Agincourt since the battle was fought on his feastday . It has been immortalised by Shakespeare 's St. Crispin 's Day Speech from his play Henry V. Also , for the Midsummer 's Day Festival in the third act of Die Meistersinger , Wagner has the shoemakers ' guild enter singing a song of praise to St. Crispin . \n \n A plaque at Faversham commemorates their association with the town . They are also commemorated in the name of the old pub `` Crispin and Crispianus '' at Strood .",

          "context": "Dorneywood is an eighteenth-century house near Burnham in the South Bucks District of Buckinghamshire , England . Originally a Georgian farmhouse , it has Victorian and later additions , and was rebuilt after a fire in 1910 . It was given to the National Trust by Lord Courtauld-Thomson in 1947 as a country home for a senior member of the Government , usually a Secretary of State or Minister of the Crown . The Dorneywood Trust has the objective of 'maintaining the mansion house and gardens of Dorneywood ' . \n \n Occupancy of the house \n \n The Prime Minister alone decides which Minister or Secretary of State is to occupy the house . In previous administrations it has been the residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and , prior to 31 May 2006 , was occupied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott . Prescott was forced to relinquish occupancy of Dorneywood , following a series of scandals over an affair with civil servant Tracey Temple and a snatched paparazzi photograph of him playing croquet on the lawn of the property whilst the Prime Minister Tony Blair was out of the country on a visit to Washington . However , given the controversies over John Prescott 's use of the house , senior politicians were reluctant to use it . The house was eventually taken over by Alistair Darling , Chancellor of the Exchequer when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in 2007 . `` A spokesman for Mr Brown ... explained that the house ... was owned by a trust , and would revert first to the Lord Mayor of London and then to the American Ambassador , if the Chancellor did not want it '' . \n \n Various former Prime Ministers ( before achieving the premiership ) have occupied the house , among them Anthony Eden ; he and his wife had disliked the house . However , on becoming Prime Minister , Alec Douglas-Home was reluctant to forsake the more comfortable and modern Dorneywood for the antique splendours of Chequers . Another , James Callaghan as Foreign Secretary , also had the use of Dorneywood ( later Chevening was to become the official country home for the holder of that office ) . The last person to have lived at the house before becoming Prime Minister was John Major . \n \n In 2010 , George Osborne , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , took occupancy of the house . \n \n Dorneywood is now used by Osborne 's successor , Philip Hammond . \n \n Interior \n \n The interior of the house contains some decorations by Rex Whistler , as well as paintings and furniture belonging to the Government Art Collection . There is also furniture belonging to the National Trust . The house is only open to the public on selected dates . \n \n Grounds \n \n The National Trust markets the property under the name `` Dorneywood Garden '' . The estate consists of the house and 215 acres of parkland , woodland and farmland . The 1930s-style gardens are open to the public on selected dates during the summer . The grounds are noted for their cottage and kitchen garden , as well as their herbaceous borders and rose displays . The upkeep of the estate is in part supported by the Dorneywood Thomson Endowment Trust Fund .",

          "context": "The GBR code ( or Guy–Blandford–Roycroft code ) is a system of representing the position of chess pieces on a chessboard . Publications such as EG use it to classify endgame types and to index endgame studies . \n \n The code is named after Richard Guy , Hugh Blandford and John Roycroft . The first two devised the original system ( the Guy–Blandford code ) using different figures to represent the number of pieces . Roycroft suggested to count one for a white piece and three for a black piece in order to make the code easier to memorise . \n \n Definition \n \n In the GBR code , every chess position is represented by six digits , in the following format : \n \n abcd.ef \n \n * a = queens \n * b = rooks \n * c = bishops \n * d = knights \n * e = white pawns \n * f = black pawns \n \n For the first four digits , each white piece counts as 1 , and each black piece counts as 3 . Thus , for example , if White has two knights and Black has one knight , numeral d 1 + 1 + 3 \n 5 . If that is all the material other than the kings , the position is classified 0005 . Values 0 through 8 represent all normal permutations of force ; 9 is used if either side has promoted material . \n \n The last two digits of the code represent the number of white and black pawns , respectively . \n \n Usage \n \n GBR code can be used to refer to a general class of material . For example , the endgame of two knights against pawn ( as famously analysed by A.A. Troitsky , leading to his discovery of the Troitsky line ) , is GBR class 0002.01 . \n \n When indexing or referring to specific positions , rather than generalised material imbalances , the code may be extended in various ways . Two common ones are to prefix `` + '' to indicate the stipulation `` White to play and win '' or `` '' for `` White to play and draw '' ; and to suffix the position of the white and black kings . With these additions , the position to the right , a draw study by Leonid Kubbel ( First Prize , Shakhmaty , 1925 ) , is classified as \n 0323.12g3g1 . ( The solution is : 1.Bf2+ Kh1 2.h7 c2+ 3.Be3 Rxe3+ 4.Kf2 Rh3 5.Bd5+ cxd5 6.hxg8Q Rh2+ 7.Kf3 c1 \n Q 8.Qg2+ Rxg2 . ) The positions of other pieces can also be added ; this produces a notation that provides the same information as Forsyth–Edwards Notation . \n \n Examples of GBR code",

According to his biographer , Robert Blake , the character of Sidonia is a cross between Lionel de Rothschild and Disraeli himself . \n \n Background \n \n The book is set against a background of the real political events of the 1830s in England that followed the enactment of the Reform Bill of 1832 . In describing these events Disraeli sets out his own beliefs including his opposition to Robert Peel , his dislikes of both the British Whig Party and the ideals of Utilitarianism , and the need for social justice in a newly industrialized society . He portrays the self-serving politician in the character of Rigby ( based on John Wilson Croker ) and the malicious party insiders in the characters of Taper and Tadpole . \n \n Plot \n \n The novel follows the life and career of Henry Coningsby , the orphan grandson of a wealthy marquess , Lord Monmouth . Lord Monmouth initially disapproved of Coningsby 's parents ' marriage , but on their death he relents and sends the boy to be educated at Eton College . At Eton Coningsby meets and befriends Oswald Millbank , the son of a rich cotton manufacturer who is a bitter enemy of Lord Monmouth . The two older men represent old and new wealth in society . \n \n As Coningsby grows up he begins to develop his own liberal political views , and falls in love with Oswald 's sister Edith . When Lord Monmouth discovers these developments he is furious and secretly disinherits his grandson . On his death , Coningsby is left penniless , and is forced to work for his living . He decides to study law and become a barrister . This proof of his character impresses Edith 's father ( who had previously also been hostile ) and he consents to their marriage at last . By the end of the novel Coningsby is elected to Parliament for his new father-in-law 's constituency and his fortune is restored . \n \n The character of Coningsby is based on George Smythe . \n The themes , and some of the characters , reappear in Disraeli 's later novels Sybil , and Tancred . \n \n Characters \n \n * Philip Augustus , Marquess of Monmouth ( Lord Cardiff ) \n * Henry Coningsby , Esq . \n * Sir Charles Buckhurst \n * Lord Eskdale \n * Duke of Beaumanoir \n * Lord Henry Sydney \n * Lord Vere \n * Lord Fitz-Booby \n * Sir Joseph Wallinger \n * Lady Wallinger \n * Oswald Millbank \n * Edith Millbank \n * Paul Prince Colonna \n * Madame Colonna \n * Lucretia Princess Colonna \n * Lucian Gay \n * Mr. Nicolas Rigby \n * Mr. Taper \n * Mr. Tadpole \n * Mr. Ormsby \n * Armand Villebecque \n * Marie Estelle Matteau ( Stella ) \n * Flora Villebecque ( La Petite ) \n * Sidonia",

There were also narratives about other eponymic legendary figures ; according to one version , Ionius was a son of Adrias ( eponymic for the Adriatic Sea ) ; according to another , Ionius was a son of Dyrrhachus . When Dyrrhachus was attacked by his own brothers , Heracles , who was passing through the area , came to his aid , but in the fight the hero killed his ally 's son by mistake .

These are often sold together in a mix , recalling the colors of the flag of Italy . Though usable with most sauces , farfalle are best suited to cream and tomato dishes . \n \n In addition to plain and whole wheat varieties , as with any pasta , other colours can be made by mixing other ingredients into the dough , which also affects the flavour ; for example , beetroot for red , spinach for green and cuttlefish ink for black . \n \n A larger variation of farfalle is known as farfallone , while there is a miniature version called farfalline . \n \n In Modena , farfalle are known as strichetti . \n \n Farfalle are not related to the similar-sounding farfel , a kind of egg-barley pasta in Jewish cuisine .",

Maurice was passionate about racing and raced in many events . However , in 1949 , he built his own car . It was nicknamed the `` Flatty '' because of its aerodynamic shape . The car caused a sensation at the Dutch Zandvoort Racetrack , passing all of the opponents including MG 's . Maurice was forced to sell the Flatty to pay creditors after trying to put his own V8 sportscar into production . The Flatty however , survived . It was found abandoned in the 1970s and has now been restored by Joop Bruggeman . It is the last surviving Gatso car . Gatsonides won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1953 driving a Ford Zephyr .",

It was ranked number three in `` The World 's 10 Most Famous Cocktails in 1934 '' , making it a very popular rival to the Martini ( # 1 ) and the Manhattan ( # 2 ) . Today , it remains a popular choice in some markets , and was formerly designated as an Official Cocktail by the International Bartender Association . Like the Manhattan , the Bronx is one of five cocktails named for one of New York City 's five boroughs , but is perhaps most closely related to the Queens , which substitutes pineapple for the Bronx 's orange . \n \n History \n \n As with several mixed drinks invented prior to prohibition in the United States , more than one story is attributed to the creation of this cocktail . \n \n Joseph S. Sormani \n \n Two sources credit Joseph S. Sormani as the person responsible for the drink . \n \n Sormani was credited with creating the drink in his New York Times obituary : \n \n Johnnie Solan \n \n According to Albert Stevens Crockett , historian of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , the inventor of the Bronx cocktail was Johnnie Solan ( or Solon ) . Solon , a pre-Prohibition bartender at the Manhattan hotel , was `` popular as one of the best mixers behind its bar counter for most of the latter 's history . '' This is Crockett 's account of Solon 's own story of the Creation of the Bronx : \n \n Solon would have created the cocktail sometime between 1899 ( when he joined the establishment ) and 1906 ( when the word first appeared in print . ) However , a prior reference to a `` Bronx Cocktail '' on a New York hotel menu indicates that either the name was already in use or Solon was not the original inventor . \n \n Bill W. 's first remembered drink \n \n Bill W. , the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous , said that his first drink of alcohol that he could remember was the `` Bronx cocktail '' , given to him by a `` socialite '' at a party right during WWI . This was the beginning of his addiction to alcohol . \n \n Other early citations \n \n It appears in William `` Cocktail '' Boothby 's 1908 book The World 's Drinks And How To Mix Them as \n `` Bronx Cocktail , a la Billy Malloy , Pittsburgh , PA . \n One-third Plymouth gin , one-third French vermouth and one-third Italian vermouth , flavored with two dashes of Orange bitters , about a barspoonful of orange juice and a squeeze of orange peel . Serve very cold . '' Harry Craddock in The Savoy cocktail book mentions three recipes from the Bronx . \n \n Flavors \n \n The Bronx is flavorful and mildly sweet `` fruity '' drink , without being uninteresting or sticky . Though possibly inspired by the Duplex , the two drinks are not really similar at all . Cocktail columnists Gary Regan and Mardee Haidin Regan describe it as a drink where `` [ g ] in is the base ingredient , orange juice is the mixer , and sweet and dry vermouths are added almost as an afterthought .

It is in Travelcard Zone 1 and is the nearest tube station to University College Hospital , being opposite the newly opened main building . It is also very close to on the Circle , Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines , which is at the other side of the hospital building . \n \n History \n \n The station opened as part of the original Charing Cross , Euston & Hampstead Railway on 22 June 1907 under the name `` Euston Road '' , and this name can still be seen in the Northern line platform tiling . The platforms were built on the outside of the running lines . The station 's name changed to `` Warren Street '' the following year . In 1934 , the current station building replaced the original when escalators were installed . The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 . As part of introducing automatic ticket gates with the Victoria line , the ability to freely interchange with Euston Square station was withdrawn on 1 March 1969 . \n \n At the next station northwards , Euston , there is cross-platform interchange between the Northbound Victoria line and Northbound Northern line ( Bank branch ) ; and Southbound Victoria line and Southbound Northern line ( Bank branch ) . To facilitate this , the Victoria line tracks had to switch from the standard left-hand running to right-hand . The Victoria line platforms at King 's Cross St. Pancras ( the next station on from Euston ) also have this feature for the same reason . \n \n Due to the right-hand running on the Victoria line and the Northern line having side platforms , the doors open on the left on all four platforms . \n \n The Northern line northbound platform of the station was used for location filming in the movie Death Line ( 1972 ) \n \n On 27 April 2012 Warren Street station became the first London Underground Wi-Fi enabled tube station . \n \n Connections \n \n London Buses routes 10 , 14 , 18 , 24 , 27 , 29 , 30 , 73 , 88 , 134 , 205 and 390 and night routes N5 , N20 , N29 , N73 , N205 , N253 and N279 serve the station . \n \n Gallery \n \n File : Warren Street stn Northern northbound look north.JPG|Northern line northbound platform looking north , July 2008 \n File : Warren Street stn Northern tiling.JPG|Tiling on Northern line southbound platform , revealing the former station name , Euston Road \n File : Warren street stn Northern roundel.JPG|Roundel on Northern line platform \n File : Warren Street stn Victoria northbound looking north.JPG|Victoria line northbound platform looking north , July 2008 .

Both athletes set three world records for the mile . Hägg first set the record in July 1942 at 4:06.2 , a time which was equalled by Anderson later the same month . This record was broken by Hägg ( 4:04.6 ) in September the same year . Andersson recaptured the world record in July 1943 ( 4:02.6 ) , and improved it further in July 1944 ( 4:01.6 ) . However , Hägg had the last word when he ran 4:01.4 in Malmö in 1945 ( Hägg 's record was not broken until Roger Bannister ran the first sub-4 mile in Oxford in 1954 ) . \n \n Hagg was also the first man to run a sub 14 minute 5000 m . \n \n In 1946 , Gunder Hägg was branded a professional because he received payments for running . He was therefore barred from competition , together with Arne Andersson and Henry Jonsson . Four years earlier , he earned the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal .",

However the County of Ross and Cromarty from which the club draws much of its support has a population of over 60,000 . The largest crowd ever to watch a match at Victoria Park was reported as 8,000 , for the Scottish Cup match between Ross County and Rangers in February 1966 . The revenue from this match helped to fund construction of the Jail End terrace . \n \n Ross County played in the Highland League until 1994 , when they were admitted to the Scottish Football League Third Division alongside Inverness Caledonian Thistle . Victoria Park then became the most northerly ground in the senior section of the Scottish football league system , until Elgin City were admitted in 2000 . \n \n Ross County gained promotion to the Scottish Premier League ( SPL ) by winning the 2011–12 Scottish First Division . The stadium was renovated in the spring and summer of 2012 to meet SPL criteria . This involved installing seats in the Jail End , constructing a new North Stand , installing undersoil heating and providing more car parking . Victoria Park was renamed the Global Energy Stadium , after the company founded by Ross County chairman Roy MacGregor , when the renovation was completed in July 2012 . \n \n Structure and facilities \n \n There are four all-seated stands : the West ( Main Stand ) and the East are on either side of the pitch , while the North Stand ( Academy End ) and the South Stand ( Jail End ) are behind each goal . The Jail End is so called because the old County Jail and Sheriff Court were behind it . The jails have since been converted to housing , but the Sheriff Court is still used . Away fans are housed in the Academy End . Home fans occupy all other sections of the stadium . There are corporate hospitality facilities and executive boxes in both the East and West Stands . \n \n The Dingwall campus of the Highland Football Academy is situated behind the Academy End . It has a three-quarter size 3G astroturf pitch under cover and a full size Astroturf pitch adjacent to the East Stand , which has markings for football , 5-a-side football and hockey . The Academy also has three full size grass pitches , plus additional grassed training and warm-up areas . \n \n Gallery \n \n File : Victoria_park_1.jpg|West Stand \n File : Victoria_park_2.jpg|Jail End",

He planned to murder the cabinet , but there was a spy and he was apprehended with 12 other conspirators . He killed a policeman during the raid . He was executed for treason . \n \n Early life \n \n He was born in Tupholme the extramarital son of a farmer and stockbreeder . He attended Horncastle Grammar School and was trained as a land surveyor . Unsatisfied with his job , he obtained a commission in the army at the age of 21 . In January 1804 he married Jane Worsley but she died two years later giving birth to their first child . In 1808 he married Susan Wilkinson . He then quit his commission in the army and , with the help of his father , bought a farm . The farm was not a success and in 1811 he moved to London . \n \n Beginning of revolutionary involvement \n \n Travel in France and the United States exposed Thistlewood to revolutionary ideas . Shortly after his return to England , he joined the Society of Spencean Philanthropists in London . By 1816 , Thistlewood had become a leader in the organisation , and was labelled a `` dangerous character '' by police , who watched him closely . \n \n Spa Fields \n \n On 2 December 1816 a mass meeting took place at Spa Fields . The Spenceans had planned to encourage rioting all across England and then seize control of the British government by taking the Tower of London and the Bank of England . Police learned of the plan and dispersed the meeting . Thistlewood attempted to flee to North America . He and three other leaders were arrested and charged with high treason . When James Watson was acquitted , the authorities released Thistlewood and the others as well . \n \n Thistlewood challenged the Home Secretary to a duel and was imprisoned in Horsham Jail for 12 months . \n \n Cato Street Conspiracy \n \n On 22 February 1820 Thistlewood was one of a small group of Spenceans who decided , at the prompting of a police agent George Edwards , to assassinate the British cabinet at a dinner the next day hosted by an earl . The group gathered in a loft in the Marylebone area of London , where police officers apprehended the conspirators . Edwards , a police spy , had fabricated the story of the dinner . Thistlewood was convicted of treason for his part in the Cato Street Conspiracy and , together with co-conspirators John Thomas Brunt , William Davidson , John Ings and Richard Tidd , was publicly hanged and decapitated outside Newgate Prison on 1 May 1820 .",

The majority of the land in the valley is still farmed despite development pressures . Farming is the primary tool for supporting the area ’ s landscape and wildlife . Arger Fen , a Site of Special Scientific Interest , contains areas of ancient woodland , meadow and fen .

Retrieved 2013-01-21 . \n \n Geology \n \n Throughout the valley Eocene and glacial deposits overlay chalk deposited during the Cretaceous period . London Clay and sands are often exposed on the valley sides as the river and its tributaries cut through the deposits . The composition of these layers and where they occur is paramount in determining what species will grow , which habitats can occur and how the area is farmed . \n \n River \n \n The River Stour is the key landscape focus for the valley , its course is defined by bank-side trees and wet meadows . It supports a variety of riparian ( river ) habitats . \n \n The valley floor has a large areas of functioning floodplain . Water quality is good , meeting levels demanded in regulations . The catchment meets sustainable demands for water supply , flood control and recreational use , whilst retaining an unspoilt character and healthy ecosystem . \n \n The river has become an important method of controlling water levels both in the surrounding countryside and irrigating crops . \n \n cmglee_Manningtree_Dedham_Vale.jpg|Dedham Vale near Manningtree \n cmglee_Manningtree_River_Stour.jpg|Wildfowl on River Stour \n \n Human influence \n \n Humans have had a great influence on the landscape including building isolated settlements , transport links and churches . Agricultural workers divided up the land to plant crops , grow timber and graze animals . \n \n The landscape continues to change as changing agricultural practices , increased leisure time and an awareness of environmental concerns all contribute to development of the Stour valley .",

It colloquially means that the name of something is an accurate description of its qualities . It is akin to the previously existing phrases `` by name and by nature '' and `` it lives up to its name '' . \n \n It originated in a series of television advertisements by the woodstain and wood-dye manufacturer Ronseal , initiated in 1994 and still being broadcast . \n \n The slogan was created by Liz Whiston and Dave Shelton at the London advertising agency HHCL . The idea of the phrase was to emphasise that the company 's products would act and last for the amount of time exactly as described on the tin can . The word tin is generally used even when the product is sold in a different type of container , although box is also sometimes used . The expression soon entered common usage in the UK.Jim Blythe . Consumer behaviour , pg.116 \n \n Such is the phrase 's ubiquity in the UK that in a 2011 news report concerning the copyrighting of phrases and expressions , a copyright expert expressed surprise that Ronseal used such a common , everyday phrase in their advertising . \n \n The phrase is also commonly known and used in Ireland . The Ronseal advertising campaign has also been shown there , and UK television is widely available in Ireland . In 2004 , toothpaste manufacturer Colgate began a similar copycat advertising campaign in Ireland stating that its product `` does exactly what it says on the tube '' . \n \n The phrase is a registered trademark of the Sherwin-Williams Company , the owner of Ronseal , across the European Community for products including paints , varnishes , and wood preservatives ( E3085826 ) . \n \n In 2007 , a song titled `` What It Says on the Tin '' was released by a British singer Katie Melua . Although the song is about relationships , the phrase has a similar meaning .",

The album featured one of Taylor 's earliest single successes : `` Fire and Rain '' , which reached # 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 . The album itself also managed to reach # 3 on the Billboard Album Charts . Sweet Baby James made Taylor one of the main forces of the ascendent folk movement .

It lies south of Corfu City in the forest of Palaiopolis . \n \n History \n \n The villa was built as a summer residence for the British Lord High Commissioner of the United States of the Ionian Islands , Frederick Adam , and his second wife ( a Corfiot ) , Diamantina 'Nina ' Palatino , in 1828–1831 , although they had to vacate the villa soon afterwards in 1832 when Adam was sent to serve in India . The villa was rarely used as a residence for the later British governors . In 1833 , it housed a school of fine arts , while in 1834 , the park was opened to the public . Empress Elisabeth of Austria stayed there in 1863 . Here she fell in love with the island , where she later built the Achilleion Palace . \n \n After the union with Greece in 1864 , the villa was granted to King George I of the Hellenes as a summer residence ; he renamed it Mon Repos . The royal family used it as a summer residence up until King Constantine II fled the country in 1967 . The villa subsequently became derelict , but was restored in the 1990s . \n \n Several royal births have taken place at the villa , including those of Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh on 10 June 1921 , and Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark on 10 July 1965 . \n \n Court rulings \n \n The villa was confiscated under controversial circumstances some years after the declaration of the Hellenic Republic in 1974 . Its confiscation , and the confiscation of other property of the deposed and exiled King Constantine II , without any compensation , led to a court case in the European Court of Human Rights . \n \n The King 's argument centred on the claim that the property in question was acquired by his predecessors legally and was therefore subject to regular personal inheritance . The Greek state argued that because the property was either used by the royal family by virtue of its sovereign status or obtained by taking advantage of that status , once the monarchy was abolished , the property reverted to public ownership automatically . \n \n The Court struck a middle course in reaching its verdict and ordered the Hellenic Republic to pay the exiled king compensation of less than 1 % of its worth but allowed the Greek state to retain ownership of the property . \n \n Archeological museum \n \n The villa and its gardens are the property of the Corfu municipality , and are now being used as an archeological museum . \n \n Notable persons born at Mon Repos \n \n * Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh \n * Princess Alexia of Greece and Denmark",

          "context": "The Peter principle is a concept in management theory formulated by Laurence J. Peter and published in 1969 in which the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate 's performance in their current role , rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role . Thus , employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively , and `` managers rise to the level of their incompetence . '' \n \n Overview \n \n The Peter principle is a special case of an ubiquitous observation : Anything that works will be used in progressively more challenging applications until it fails . This is the `` generalized Peter principle '' . There is much temptation to use what has worked before , even when this might not be appropriate for the current situation . Laurence J. Peter observed this about humans . \n \n In an organizational structure , assessing an employee 's potential for a promotion is often based on their performance in the current job . This eventually results in their being promoted to their highest level of competence and potentially then to a role in which they are not competent , referred to as their `` level of incompetence '' . The employee has no chance of further promotion , thus reaching their career 's ceiling in an organization . \n \n Peter suggests that `` In time , every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties '' and [ the corollary ] that `` work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence . '' He coined the term hierarchiology as the social science concerned with the basic principles of hierarchically organized systems in the human society . \n \n He noted that their incompetence may be because the required skills are different , but not more difficult . For example , an excellent engineer may be a poor manager because they might not have the interpersonal skills necessary to lead a team . \n \n Rather than seeking to promote a talented `` super-competent '' junior employee , Peter suggested that an incompetent manager may set them up to fail or dismiss them because they are likely to `` violate the first commandment of hierarchical life with incompetent leadership : the hierarchy must be preserved '' . \n \n Research \n \n Alessandro Pluchino , Andrea Rapisarda , and Cesare Garofalo used an agent-based modelling approach to simulate the promotion of employees in a system where the Peter principle is assumed to be true . They found that the best way to improve efficiency in an enterprise is to promote people randomly , or to shortlist the best and the worst performer in a given group , from which the person to be promoted is then selected randomly . For this work , they won the 2010 edition of the parody Ig Nobel Prize in management science . \n \n Comparable texts \n \n José Ortega y Gasset suggested that : `` All public employees should be demoted to their immediately lower level , as they have been promoted until turning incompetent '' . Ortega died in 1955 , about 14 years before Peter published The Peter Principle .",

It was established in 2009 , with its head office in Gloucester , and is now owned by Hitachi . \n \n Early history \n \n The company was established in 2009 as an E.ON UK and RWE npower joint venture . The company announced its intention to install about 6,000 MWe of new nuclear capacities adjacent to the existing Oldbury and Wylfa nuclear power stations . Horizon initially evaluated building either Areva 1,650 MWe EPR reactors or Westinghouse 1,100 MWe AP1000 reactors between 2020 and 2024 . \n \n In March 2012 E.ON and RWE npower placed Horizon up for sale as a going concern . One bidder was a joint venture of China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group and the China National Nuclear Corporation . \n \n However , on 29 October 2012 it was announced that Hitachi would buy Horizon for £696 million , and the sale was completed on 26 November 2012 . \n \n Hitachi ownership \n \n Hitachi intends to build two to three 1,350 MWe Advanced Boiling Water Reactors ( ABWR ) on each site , but will first require a Generic Design Assessment for the ABWR by the Office for Nuclear Regulation , which is likely to take from two to four years . The assessment began in April 2013 , with an agreement that the costs of assessment will be covered by Hitachi-GE . In August 2014 , the proposed reactor type reached the third stage , out of four , in the GDA process . This processes should be fully completed in 2018 . \n \n Horizon planned initial site work at Wylfa to begin in 2015 , with building work starting in 2018 and generation starting in the mid-2020s . \n \n In January 2016 Hitachi announced a new UK company , Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe , to lead a proposed joint venture with Bechtel and JGC Corporation , to cover the engineering , procurement and construction of Horizon 's nuclear plants in the UK . Horizon Nuclear Power will continue to work on obtaining regulatory consents and making commercial arrangements . \n However , later in the month Hiroaki Nakanishi , chairman and chief executive of Hitachi , expressed serious concerns to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond over financing the development , following EDF 's difficulty in financing its Hinkley Point C nuclear power station development . Hitachi is currently negotiating with the Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) on electricity price guarantees , called Contracts for Difference ( CfD ) . \n \n In May 2016 Duncan Hawthorne , previously CEO of Bruce Power in Canada , was appointed CEO of Horizon .",

It is also known as an abaciscus or abaculus . \n \n Historical tessera \n \n In early antiquity , mosaics were formed from naturally formed colored pebbles , but by 200 BCE cut stone tesserae were being used in Ancient Roman decorative mosaic panels and floor mosaics . Marble or limestone were cut into small cubes and arranged into representational designs and geometric patterns . \n \n Later , tesserae were made from colored glass , or clear glass backed with metal foils . The Byzantines used tesserae with gold leaf , in which case the glass pieces were flatter , with two glass pieces sandwiching the gold . This produced a golden reflection emanating from in between the tesserae as well as their front , causing a far richer and more luminous effect than even plain gold leaf would create . \n \n Contemporary tessera \n \n ; Vitreous glass : \n These are manufactured glass tiles made to a uniform shape and size . They are made by molten glass being poured into trays and fired . An imprint of grooves is made on their underside for help with adhesion to cement when fixing . \n ; Ceramic tesserae : \n These are the cheapest range of bought materials and can be glazed or unglazed . The glazed ceramic tiles have the color painted onto the top of the clay and then fired to a high temperature in a kiln . The unglazed or body glazed version has the color mixed into the wet clay so the color runs through them . They vary in size . \n \n ; Smalti : \n This is the classic mosaic material . It is opaque glass fired in large slabs in a kiln and then hand cut with a hammer and hardy chisel into small cubes . Their irregular finish makes them a wonderful reflector of light and this material is best used working straight into cement . It is produced in Venice and sold by colour and weight . \n ; Gold smalti : \n This tile is made with real gold and silver leaf sandwiched between two layers of glass and fired twice in the kiln to embed in the metal . \n ; Mirror : \n Mirror adds great depth and sparkle to a mosaic . It is cheap as offcuts from a glass cutting shop are often free . Use mirror glue as this protects the silver on the back of the mirror . \n ; Stained glass : \n Known for its translucent qualities stained glass is also available in opaque form . It comes as large sheets that can be cut into smaller sections with a glasscutter . It can provide areas of larger tesserae pieces for variety and contrast . \n ; Household ceramic tiles & china : \n Colours and surfaces are limitless and can add wonderful texture and contrast to mosaic work .",

It can also be gained with less climbing from the Cat and Fiddle Inn . \n \n Views \n \n As it is the highest point around ( it is some 8 m higher than the summit of Axe Edge Moor above Buxton ) , the views are pleasant , though the relatively flat uplands mean they are not extensive in all directions : the view to the southwest of the peak of Shutlingsloe above Wildboarclough is particularly notable , and in clear conditions Winter Hill near Bolton , the city of Manchester and much of the Cheshire Plain can be seen , including the radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank 20 km to the west . In very clear but not unusual conditions North Wales and even Snowdonia can be seen . \n \n Geology \n \n The north–south ridge of Shining Tor including the summit itself is formed from the Chatsworth Grit , a thick sandstone of Namurian age which occurs widely across the Peak District . The beds dip moderately steeply to the east into a north–south-aligned syncline known as the Goyt Trough . Shining Tor is thought to have stood above the ice sheet during the last ice age and so is free from glacial deposits .

          "context": "The bluebottle fly or bottlebee ( Calliphora vomitoria ) is a common blow fly found in most areas of the world and is the type species for the genus Calliphora . Its larva , used as fishing bait , is called a maggot , while its pupa , also widely used for bait , is called a caster . Similar species include the greenbottle fly , a close relative that can be distinguished by its bright green metallic colouring . Bluebottle fly adults feed on nectar , while the larvae feed on carcasses of dead animals . Adults are also pollinators to some flowers with strong odor . \n \n Description \n \n It is 10 - long , slightly larger than a housefly . The head and thorax are dull gray and the abdomen is bright metallic blue with black markings . Its body and legs are covered with black bristle-like hair . It has short , clubbed antennae and 4 tarsi per leg . The eyes are red and the wings are transparent . The legs and antennae are black and pink . The chest is bright purple and has spikes to protect themselves against other flies . These insects like to fly in packs in order to detect possible prey more efficiently . If one fly detects food , it will disperse a pheromone which will alert the others to the meal . \n \n Life cycle \n \n A female blue bottle fly lays her eggs where she feeds , usually in decaying meat , garbage , or feces . Pale whitish larvae , commonly called maggots , soon hatch from the eggs and immediately begin feeding on the decomposing matter where they were hatched . After a few days of feeding , they are fully grown . At that time they will crawl away to a dry place where they can burrow into soil or similar matter to pupate into tough brown cocoons . After two or three weeks , the adults emerge to mate , beginning the cycle again . During cold weather , pupae and adults can hibernate until higher temperatures revive them . \n \n They are pollinators of some flowers with a strong odor such as skunk cabbage and goldenrod . \n \n Gallery \n \n File : Calliphora vomitoria Portrait.jpg|Calliphora vomitoria head shot",

The Black was developed in Europe from the Aztec turkeys originally brought from Mexico by Spanish explorers . Despite the monikers of “ Spanish and “ Norfolk ” ( England ) , birds of this type live in many European nations . Originally , black colored turkeys were a relative rarity among New World flocks , but Europeans heavily selected for this trait until it became predominant . \n The `` Norfolk Black '' is generally considered the oldest turkey breed in the UK \n \n Black turkeys were sent in the holds of ships on the transatlantic crossing from Europe to the New World , and were raised by early colonists . Ironically , it is likely that the turkey consumed at the first Thanksgiving meal may have actually been from European birds , rather than wild turkeys native to the continent , though these descended from same bird . \n \n Later , Blacks were crossed with the wild turkey to help produce breeds such as the Bronze , Narragansett , and Slate . They remained a commercially farmed variety in the U.S. until the early 20th century , but fell out of favor after the development of the Broad Breasted Bronze and Broad Breasted White . Fairly common in Europe , they are considered an endangered variety of heritage turkey today by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy , and are also included in Slow Food USA 's Ark of Taste , a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction .",

He led the Pilgrimage of Grace protest in 1536 ; King Henry VIII of England had him executed for treason on 12 July 1537 . \n \n Biography \n \n Aske was the younger son of Sir Robert Aske of Aughton near Selby , a scion of an old Yorkshire family . The family was well connected : one of Aske 's cousins was Henry Clifford , 2nd Earl of Cumberland , his first cousin once removed , for his mother Elizabeth Clifford was the daughter of John Clifford , 9th Baron de Clifford , and Margaret Bromflete ; Queen Jane Seymour was also his third cousin through the same line . \n \n Aske became a lawyer , and was a Fellow at Gray 's Inn . A devout man , he objected to Henry 's religious reforms , particularly the Dissolution of the Monasteries . When rebellion broke out in York against Henry VIII , Aske was returning to Yorkshire from London . Not initially involved in the rebellion , he took up the cause of the locals and headed the Pilgrimage of Grace . By 10 October 1536 he had come to be regarded as their `` chief captain '' . Most of Yorkshire , and parts of Northumberland , Durham , Cumberland and Westmorland were in revolt . \n \n On 13 November 1536 , Aske treated with the royal delegates , including the Duke of Norfolk , and received an assurance of an audience and safe passage to the king . Among the insurgents ' requests was the punishment of heretical bishops and of the king 's evil advisers , the recall of his anti-ecclesiastical legislation , the prosecution of his `` visitors '' , Lee and Layton , and the holding of a parliament in the North .

New York : Robert Appleton Company , 1907 . 13 Jul . 2015 He travelled to London , met Henry VIII , and received promises of redress and safe passage . \n \n As he began his journey back north , fighting broke out again . This renewed fighting allowed Henry to change his mind , and he had Robert Aske seized and brought to the Tower of London . He was convicted of high treason in Westminster and was taken back to York , where he was hanged in chains on 12 July 1537 , on a special scaffold erected outside Clifford 's Tower . \n \n Portrayals \n \n Aske was played by Sean Bean in the 2003 television serial Henry VIII , in which he is inaccurately portrayed as a violent former lieutenant of Henry 's army . \n \n Aske is also portrayed by Gerard McSorley in the third season of Showtime 's The Tudors . At the time of filming , McSorley was twenty years older than Aske was when he died . The series also shows Aske with a young family , while , in fact , he was not married . \n \n The circumstances surrounding Aske 's life feature prominently in C. J. Sansom 's novel Sovereign and H.

It centres on Edith Hope , a romance novelist who is staying in a hotel on the shores of Lake Geneva . There she meets other English visitors , including Mrs Pusey , Mrs Pusey 's daughter Jennifer , and an attractive middle-aged man , Mr Neville . \n \n Plot \n \n Edith reaches Hotel du Lac in a state of bewildered confusion at the turn of events in her life . After a secret and often lonely affair with a married man and an aborted marriage , she is banished by her friends . They advise her to go on `` probation '' so as to `` grow up '' , `` be a woman '' , and atone for her mistakes . \n \n Edith comes to the hotel swearing not to change . However , the hotel 's silent charms and her observations of the guests there all tug at Edith with questions about her identity , forcing her to examine who she is and what she has been . At the hotel , she observes people from different walks of life — Mrs Pusey and her daughter Jennifer , their love for each other , and the splendid oblivious lives they live ; Mme de Bonneuil , who lives at the hotel in solitary expulsion from her son ; and Monica , who came to the hotel acceding to her husband 's demands . Edith falls for the ambiguous smile of Mr Neville , who asks for her hand in marriage . She considers a life of recognition that being married to Neville would confer upon her , but ultimately rejects the possibility of a relationship with him when she realises he is an incorrigible womaniser . This also finally leads her to realise what her life is expected to be . Once again , she breaks chains and decides to take things into her own hands and leaves hotel du lac . \n \n Awards \n \n The novel won the Booker Prize in 1984 . \n \n Film adaptation \n \n A film of the same name was adapted for television by Christopher Hampton and produced by the BBC and A & E Television Networks in 1986 .",

Zeebrugge serves as both the international port of Bruges-Zeebrugge and a seafront resort with hotels , cafés , a marina and a beach . \n \n Location \n \n Located on the coast of the North Sea , its central location on the Belgian coast , short distance to Great Britain and close vicinity to densely populated industrialised cities make Zeebrugge a crossroads for traffic from all directions . An expressway to Bruges connects Zeebrugge to the European motorway system ; one can also get to and from Zeebrugge by train or tram . \n \n It is Belgium 's most important fishing port and the wholesale fish market located there is one of the largest in Europe . \n \n Aside from being a passenger terminal with ferries to the United Kingdom , the harbour serves as the central port for Europe 's automotive industry , and it is important for the import , handling and storage of energy products , agriculture products and other general cargo . Zeebrugge has the largest LNG terminal complex in Europe . \n \n History \n \n The harbour was the site of the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918 , when the British Royal Navy temporarily put the German inland naval base at Bruges out of action . Admiral Roger Keyes planned and led the raid that stormed the German batteries and sank three old warships at the entrance to the canal leading to the inland port . This action blocked access to the port and prevented U-boats and other shipping from using it . The raid , although a morale boosting victory in Britain , was only a partial military success . \n \n Later , Zeebrugge 's harbour was the scene of disaster when in 1987 the MS Herald of Free Enterprise passenger ferry capsized killing 193 people . \n \n Passenger ferry routes \n \n * P & O Ferries to Hull , United Kingdom \n * Zeebrugge - Rosyth ferry service operated by Norfolkline to Rosyth , United Kingdom ( from May 2009 ) ( This service ended on 15 December 2010 )",

It is generally made from pork fat or beef suet , pork blood and a relatively high proportion of oatmeal , in some recipes mixed with grits ( oat groats ) and sometimes even barley groats . Black pudding pre-sliced may still have a plastic wrap around the circumference that must be removed before cooking . \n \n Savoury \n \n Black pudding is often grilled , fried , baked or boiled in its skin . It can be eaten cold as it is cooked in production . \n It was occasionally flavoured with pennyroyal , differing from continental European versions in its relatively limited range of ingredients and reliance on oatmeal and barley instead of onions or chitterlings to absorb and be mixed with the blood.Jaine , T. and Davidson , A . The Oxford companion to food , OUP , 2006 , p.104 \n \n In the United Kingdom , black pudding is considered a delicacy in the Black Country , the West Midlands , Stornoway , the North West , and especially in Greater Manchester ( in towns such as Bury ) , where it is traditionally boiled and served with malt vinegar out of paper wrapping . [ http : //www.manchester2002-uk.com/eat & drink/local-dishes.html Lancashire and Cheshire Regional Dishes ] , accessed 30 April 2010 The Stornoway black pudding , made in the Western Isles of Scotland , has been granted Protected Geographical Indicator of Origin status . In the wake of this designation , butchers in Bury sought to demonstrate their history of manufacturing and selling the product . One such claim dates back to 1810 . \n \n Black puddings are also served sliced and fried or grilled as part of a traditional full breakfast in much of the UK and Ireland , a tradition that followed British and Irish emigrants around the world . Black pudding is now part of the local cuisine of the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador . \n \n In Scotland and the north of England , chip shops commonly sell black pudding battered and deep-fried . Prepared in this way , it is eaten as a meal with chips , replacing the better-known battered fish . \n \n Novel culinary uses for black pudding include black pudding ice cream , while perhaps more conventional modern recipes include using it as an accompaniment to pigeon . \n \n Nutrition \n \n Black pudding is a good source of protein , is low in carbohydrate and high in zinc and iron but is also high in saturated fat and cholesterol . \n \n Festivals \n \n Since the 1980s , the World Black Pudding Throwing Championships has been held in Ramsbottom . The humorous competition invokes the traditional Lancashire – Yorkshire rivalry , with participants throwing the black puddings at piles of Yorkshire puddings . It takes place annually in September , and draws thousands of competitors and spectators to the town . \n \n In past years the Bacup Food and Black Pudding Festival has been held in Bacup . \n \n Manchester Egg \n \n The `` Manchester Egg '' is a modern variant of the Scotch egg . It features Lancashire black pudding encasing a pickled egg .",

          "context": "The corridor of uncertainty is a phrase originating from the sport of cricket . It describes an area where a cricket ball can pitch during a delivery : a narrow line on and just outside a batsman 's off stump . The name is derived from the opinion that this is the area in which a batsman struggles most to determine whether to play forward or back , or whether to leave the delivery . If a batsman leaves the ball , there 's a chance the ball will turn inward and either bowl him or hit him with an increased chance of leg before wicket . If a batsman plays the ball , there 's a chance the ball will go to the outside instead , leading to an outside edge that can be easily caught . \n \n The first recorded use of the phrase is often , perhaps wrongly , credited to former Yorkshire and England batsman , now commentator , Geoffrey Boycott whilst commentating on England 's 1990 tour of the West Indies . There are other earlier claims to coinage , however , including a televised interview with Merv Hughes who says Allan Border instructed him to bowl in the `` corridor of uncertainty '' at one point in the 1988-1989 West Indies tour of Australia . Among the references found online , one that predates Boycott 's claim by several months is an article from the Age on July 11 , 1989 where Martin Blake attributed it to Terry Alderman . It says that Alderman `` rarely strayed from the `` corridor of uncertainty '' that he coined himself several years ago '' \n \n The phrase has also been used in other sports commentary . In football it is commonly used to describe a cross or pass which is delivered into the area in front of the goalkeeper and behind the last line of defence . The `` uncertainty '' in this case comes from the decision which both the last defender and the goalkeeper must make : whether to defend the ball , or leave it to the other player . \n \n `` Corridor of uncertainty '' is also the name , or part of the name , of several online cricket forums and at least two fanzine-type cricket publications .",

          "context": "A plane mirror is a mirror with a flat ( planar ) reflective surface . For light rays striking a plane mirror , the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence . The angle of incidence is the angle between the incident ray and the surface normal ( an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface ) . Therefore the angle of reflection is the angle between the reflected ray and the normal and a collimated beam of light does not spread out after reflection from a plane mirror , except for diffraction effects . \n \n A plane mirror makes an image of objects in front of it ; these images appear to be behind the plane in which the mirror lies . A straight line drawn from part of an object to the corresponding part of its image makes a right angle with , and is bisected by , the surface of the plane mirror . The image formed by a plane mirror is always virtual ( meaning that the light rays do not actually come from the image ) , upright , and of the same shape and size as the object it is reflecting . A virtual image is a copy of an object formed at the location from which the light rays appear to come . However , the image is a laterally-inverted `` mirror image '' of the object . If a person is reflected in a plane mirror , the image of his right hand appears to be the left hand of the image . \n \n Plane mirrors are the only type of mirror for which a real object always produces an image that is virtual , erect and of the same size as the object . Virtual objects produce real images , however . The focal length of a plane mirror is infinity ; its optical power is zero . \n \n Preparation \n \n It is made using some highly reflecting and polished surface such as a silver or aluminum surface in a process called silvering after silvering a thin layer of red lead oxide is applied at the back of the mirror . The reflecting surface reflects most of the light striking it as long as the surface a remains uncontaminated by tarnishing or oxidation . Most modern plane mirrors are designed with a thin piece of plate glass that protects and strengthens the mirror surface and helps prevent tarnishing . Historically , mirrors were simply flat pieces of polished copper , obsidian , brass , or a precious metal . Mirrors made from liquid also exist , as the elements gallium and mercury are both highly reflective in their liquid state . \n \n Relation to curved mirrors \n \n Mathematically , a plane mirror can be considered to be the limit of either a concave or a convex spherical curved mirror as the radius , and therefore the focal length , becomes infinite .",

It is connected by a causeway called The Ayre to South Walls . Unusually , the two islands are treated as one entity by the UK census . \n \n Description \n \n The dramatic coastline of Hoy greets visitors travelling to Orkney by ferry from the Scottish mainland . It has extremes of many kinds : some of the highest sea cliffs in the UK at St John 's Head , which reach 350 m ; the impressive and famous sea stack , the Old Man of Hoy ; some of the most northerly surviving natural woodland in the British Isles and the remote possibility that the Orkney charr ( Salvelinus inframundus ) , last described in 1908 , survive in Heldale Water . The most northerly Martello Towers were built to defend the area during the Napoleonic War , but were never used in combat . \n \n The highest point in Orkney , Ward Hill , is on Hoy . \n \n The main naval base for the British fleet Scapa Flow in both the First and Second World Wars was situated at Lyness in the south-east of the island . Some rather incongruous Art Deco structures nearby date from this period . \n \n An unusual rock-cut tomb , the Dwarfie Stane , lies in the Rackwick valley in the north of the island . It is unique in northern Europe , bearing similarity to Neolithic or Bronze Age tombs around the Mediterranean . The tomb gets its name as it is very small and was said to be carved by dwarfs . \n \n In Norse mythology , Hoy is the location of the never-ending battle between Hedin and Högni . \n \n Orkney Ferries serve the island with two routes , one of which links Lyness on Hoy and Longhope on Walls with the island of Flotta and Houton on the Orkney Mainland . The other route links Moaness in Hoy to the island of Graemsay and Stromness on Orkney Mainland . \n \n Hoy is part of the Hoy and West Mainland National Scenic Area , one of 40 in Scotland . \n \n Wildlife \n \n Hoy is an Important Bird Area . \n The northern part of the island is an RSPB reserve due to its importance for birdlife , particularly Great skuas and red-throated divers . It was sold to the RSPB by the Hoy Trust for a minimal amount . \n Anastrepta orcadensis , a liverwort also known as Orkney Notchwort , was first discovered on Ward Hill by William Jackson Hooker in 1808 .

          "context": "Crown Imperial is an orchestral march by the English composer William Walton . It was first performed at the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and was substantially revised in 1953 . Walton originally composed the march for performance at the coronation of King Edward VIII , scheduled for 12 May 1937 , but Edward abdicated in 1936 . The coronation was held on the scheduled day , with Edward 's brother being crowned instead . \n \n Walton derived the march 's title from the line `` In beawtie berying the crone imperiall '' from William Dunbar 's poem `` In Honour of the City of London '' . \n \n Crown Imperial was also performed at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 , along with another Coronation March written by Walton , Orb and Sceptre . Although there was contemporary criticism of the march as `` unrepresentative of the composer '' and `` frankly a pastiche '' of the `` pomp and circumstance '' style , Crown Imperial is now one of the most popular of Walton 's orchestral compositions . It was performed again as a recessional piece to the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011 . \n \n The march falls into an ABABC form : an exciting march in C major over Waltonesque long pedal points is followed by an Elgarian trio section in A-flat major . Then both march and trio reappear in C again and come to a conclusion in a small heroic coda . In keeping with the description of this work as `` Elgarian '' , one past nickname for the march was `` Pomp and Circumstance March No . 6 '' . \n \n It has been arranged for organ by Herbert Murrill and can be found as such in A Walton Organ Album , compiled by Robert Gower and published by Oxford University Press . Christopher Palmer prepared a version of Crown Imperial for solo organ , brass , timpani and percussion ( with harp ad lib ) , specifically for the Laurence Olivier Memorial Service in October 1989 . \n \n The composer 's autograph manuscript score is located at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library , at Yale University ( Frederick R. Koch Collection—MS FRKF 595a , short score , 11 pp ; and MS FRKF 595b , full score , 45 pp ) .",

In England in around 1300 , various different `` hundreds '' ( centem in Medieval Latin ) were defined . The Weights and Measures Act of 1835 formally established the present imperial hundredweight of 112 lb . The use in trade of measures by `` cental '' , `` hundredweight '' , or `` quintal '' have now been banned in the United Kingdom under the Weights and Measures Act of 1985 . \n \n The United States and Canada came to use the term `` hundredweight '' to refer to a unit of 100 lb . This measure was specifically banned from British use—upon risk of being sued for fraud—by the Weights and Measures Act of 1824 but , in 1879 , the measure was legalized under the name `` cental '' in response to legislative pressure from British merchants importing wheat and tobacco from the United States . \n \n Use \n \n The short hundredweight is commonly used in the US in the sale of livestock and some cereal grains and oilseeds , paper , and concrete additives and on some commodities in futures exchanges \n \n A few decades ago , commodities weighed in terms of long hundredweight included cattle , cattle fodder , fertilizers , coal , some industrial chemicals , other industrial materials , and so on . However , since increasing metrication in most English-speaking countries , it is now less used . Church bell ringers use the unit commonly , although church bell manufacturers are increasingly moving over to the metric system . \n \n Older blacksmiths ' anvils are often stamped with a three-digit number indicating their total weight in hundredweight , quarter-hundredweight ( 28 lb ) , and pounds . Thus , an anvil stamped `` 1.1.8 '' will weigh 148 lb ( 112 lb + 28 lb + 8 lb ) .",

As of 2016 its CEO was Majlind Lazimi . \n \n History \n \n Beginnings in the Ottoman Empire \n \n Albania 's postal service dates from the Ottoman Empire . According to contemporary sources and histories , the first post offices probably opened during the 1840s and 1850s . A more organized service started in 1878 , and offices were opened in every city . At the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century , two overseas shipping companies established offices in Albania , which also served as post offices for deliveries abroad . These were the Austrian Lloyd Company and the Italian Company of Apulia . They had establishments in all coastal cities of Albania : Shkoder , Durres , Vlorë , Sarande and Shengjin . \n \n After independence \n \n On 5 December 1912 , one week after Albania declared its independence , the Provisional Government of Ismail Qemali founded the Albanian postal , telephonic and telegraphic services . The Provisional Government also founded the Ministry of Telegraphs and Communications , whose first minister was Lef Nosi . The first Albanian postal stamps were issued on 5 May 1913 . Under this government , six different stamps were produced . \n \n On 7 July 1913 , the Albanian Provisional Government applied to become a member of the General Postal Union , a process that was completed on 1 March 1922 . During this time , 17 offices were connected by of cables . The headquarters in Tirana consisted of a director , four telegraphists , a prime telegraphist , two postal workers and a delivery worker . In 1938 , 68 postal offices and agencies operated throughout Albania . As Italian investment grew in the country , the need to communicate with Italy became more important . For this reason , the Albanian government decided to install a short-wave radio station , which enabled telephone and telegraph connections between Rome and Tirana . \n \n Communist period ( 1946-1990 ) \n \n During World War II , many networks and lines were damaged . In 1946 , a new telephone line was installed between Tirana and Peshkopi , which was extended to connect Tirana with Belgrade and Skopje . Connections were established throughout the country and by the 1970s post offices opened in every city or village in Albania . \n \n Post-Communist era ( 1990- ) \n \n Many international companies , such as DHL , TNT , UPS and FedEx , started operating in Albania . Posta Shqiptare began to provide financial services . From 1998 to 2001 , the infrastructure was improved , funded by private investment . In September 1999 , law number 8530 was approved by Parliament . According to the law , postal services can be offered by any postal company , except for those reserved for Posta Shqiptare . Since 2008 , Posta Shqiptare has 15 postal affiliates and 19 branches . It offers service to 553 post offices throughout Albania . Albanian Post ( based on PAP1 ) offers free internet at 553 offices . Albanian Post planned to start the implementation of PAP2 in cooperation with Prefectures , Municipalities and Communes of the country , adding 1200 points of free internet .",

However the river is only actually called the Elwy at the village of Llangernyw , where three rivers , Afon Cledwen , Afon Collen and Afon Gallen , meet to form the Elwy . It flows eastwards through Llanfair Talhaiarn and a few miles downstream from this village it is joined by a tributary , the River Aled ( Afon Aled ) which has its source in Llyn Aled . \n \n After passing through Bont-newydd , the river turns northwards again and flows through St. Asaph ( Llanelwy or `` the church enclosure on the Elwy '' in Welsh ) . It joins the River Clwyd about half way between St. Asaph and Rhuddlan , and the waters of the two rivers can often be seen flowing side by side for several miles . \n \n A number of caves along the lower valley of the Elwy are of great archaeological interest and are considered one of the most important groups of Palaeolithic and later caves and rock shelters in Britain .

Prior to Newcastle Gosforth moving in , the site had been the Newcastle Chronicle and Journal Sports Ground . \n \n The stadium has a capacity of 10,200 people . The stadium was built in stages , with the West Stand being the newest and most modern . There are plans to expand the exposed North Stand to give more protection from the elements and to provide more facilities for the fans . The South Stand ( John Smith 's stand ) is all standing but it has good protection from the elements and facilities for the fans underneath the stand . \n \n Through the 2013–14 rugby and football seasons , the stadium had a grass surface . In March 2014 , Premiership Rugby ( operators of the Aviva Premiership ) approved Newcastle Falcons ' plan to install an advanced artificial pitch during the 2014 close season , and Newcastle City Council approved the plan in May . The new artificial pitch , the second in the Aviva Premiership , was installed by SIS Pitches , the company responsible for the Premiership 's first such pitch at Saracens ' Allianz Park . \n \n The nearest Tyne and Wear Metro station is the Bank Foot station . \n \n Northumbria University and the club are to develop the UK ’ s first ever rugby-based Centre of Sporting Excellence at Kingston Park . \n \n Ownership \n \n Newcastle Falcons own the stadium , having bought the ground back in June 2015 . The stadium was previously owned by Northumbria University who bought it in late 2008 for an undisclosed fee . The Newcastle Falcons were leasing the site back from Northumbria University , in a similar fashion to the agreement with the previous owner . Included in the university deal for the 23 acre site is the rugby stadium , the land around the stadium and the car park . The former owner was the Northern Rock bank , who purchased it in 2007 for £14,756,646 .",

There she meets other English visitors , including Mrs Pusey , Mrs Pusey 's daughter Jennifer , and an attractive middle-aged man , Mr Neville . \n \n Plot \n \n Edith reaches Hotel du Lac in a state of bewildered confusion at the turn of events in her life . After a secret and often lonely affair with a married man and an aborted marriage , she is banished by her friends . They advise her to go on `` probation '' so as to `` grow up '' , `` be a woman '' , and atone for her mistakes . \n \n Edith comes to the hotel swearing not to change . However , the hotel 's silent charms and her observations of the guests there all tug at Edith with questions about her identity , forcing her to examine who she is and what she has been . At the hotel , she observes people from different walks of life — Mrs Pusey and her daughter Jennifer , their love for each other , and the splendid oblivious lives they live ; Mme de Bonneuil , who lives at the hotel in solitary expulsion from her son ; and Monica , who came to the hotel acceding to her husband 's demands . Edith falls for the ambiguous smile of Mr Neville , who asks for her hand in marriage . She considers a life of recognition that being married to Neville would confer upon her , but ultimately rejects the possibility of a relationship with him when she realises he is an incorrigible womaniser . This also finally leads her to realise what her life is expected to be .

However following the creation of the FA Premier League it subsequently became a second level division . In 2004 it was rebranded as the Football League Championship . \n \n History \n \n The Football League was founded in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor . It originally consisted of a single division of 12 clubs ( Accrington , Aston Villa , Blackburn Rovers , Bolton Wanderers , Burnley , Derby County , Everton , Notts County , Preston North End , Stoke ( now Stoke City ) , West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers ) , known as The Football League . When the League admitted additional members from the rival Football Alliance in 1892 , it was split into two divisions . \n \n For the next 100 years , the First Division was the top professional league in English football . Then , in 1992 the 22 clubs making up the First Division elected to resign from the Football League and set up the Premier League . The Football League was consequently re-organised , with the Second , Third and Fourth Divisions now renamed the First , Second and Third respectively . Thus , the First Division , while still the top level of the Football League , now became the second level of the entire English football league system . \n \n The First Division was renamed as the Football League Championship prior to the start of the 2004–05 season , as part of a league-wide rebrand . \n \n Liverpool were the most frequent winners of the First Division when it was the top flight of English football , winning it a total of 18 times . \n \n After the creation of the Premier League , the new Division One title was won more than once by only one club ; Sunderland , who won it in 1996 and 1999 . \n \n Size \n \n The First Division initially consisted of 12 founder clubs ; since then it has undergone a series of expansions as football became more popular and the number of quality teams increased .

Emmentaler dates to the time of ancient history . \n \n Production \n \n Three types of bacteria are used in the production of Emmentaler : Streptococcus thermophilus , Lactobacillus helveticus , and Propionibacterium freudenreichii . The large holes formed within the cheese are caused by a presence of hay particles which cause gradually larger holes when the cheese is being matured . ( This research has not been peer reviewed . ) Historically , the holes were a sign of imperfection , and until modern times , cheese makers would try to avoid them . Emmentaler cheese is used in a variety of dishes , particularly in gratins , and fondue , where it is mixed with Gruyère . \n \n Emmentaler in Switzerland in the 21st century \n \n * Emmentaler Switzerland AOC has been registered since 2000 as an appellation d'origine contrôlée ( AOC ) .

In 1725 , dancing master Pierre Rameau credited the codification of these five positions to choreographer Pierre Beauchamp . Two additional positions , known as the sixth and seventh positions , were codified by Serge Lifar in the 1930s while serving as Ballet Master at the Paris Opéra Ballet , though their use is limited to Lifar 's choreographies .

It is not a tributary of any other river , instead having an estuary that joins the sea near Brightlingsea . \n \n Sources \n \n The Colne 's two main tributaries start near the villages of Stambourne Green and Birdbrook in Essex . These converge in Great Yeldham , and then flow through Sible Hedingham , Halstead , Earls Colne , Colne Engaine , White Colne , Chappel and Ford Street before reaching Colchester . \n \n In Colchester \n \n The Colne Valley has a flood plain which spans approximately 300 metres by the time it enters Colchester . This area is used as pasture , as the river at this stage has no safeguards against it rising the two feet it needs to burst its banks , although it is split between two pasture areas in Spring Lane , Old Lexden . Roughly to the south of Colchester North Station , the river passes under a bridge and into a concrete-lined area that was used as an open-air bathing facility until the 1970s , and is now used by canoeists . \n \n It then meanders under a road bridge at the bottom of North Hill , and tumbles down a weir used for discharge control at Middlemill , the site of a now-demolished mill . It forms the border of Colchester 's Castle Park and the cricket ground , and footbridges cross it to provide access from the town centre to residential areas on the north side of the flood plain , which occasionally floods should the river rise too much . The river encircles one side of a small lake , and then turns south-east , and then south , before falling over a large weir and becoming tidal . \n \n After Colchester \n \n Beyond this point , the river shows significant mud banks at low tide , and flows through the Hythe , past the University of Essex campus , and then through the villages of Rowhedge and Wivenhoe past the tidal barrier and down to Brightlingsea . Downstream from the barrier , the Colne is marked by navigation buoys . \n \n Situation \n \n The banks of the Colne frequently incorporate Second World War pillboxes , particularly close to navigable crossings . \n \n From Castle Park to Wivenhoe Railway Station , National Cycle Network Route 51 roughly follows the course of the Colne .

However , the river is no longer deep enough to support ships large enough to make this viable , and water trade is now non-existent . Victorian-era plans to dredge the river once more ultimately failed .",

In engraving , it is sometimes depicted as a region of vertical lines or else marked with gu . as an abbreviation . \n \n In Polish heraldry , gules is the most common tincture of the field . Through the sixteenth century , nearly half of all noble coats of arms in Poland had a field gules with one or more argent charges on them . \n \n The original coat of arms of the d'Albret family was plain gules . \n \n Sometimes , the different tinctures are said to be connected with special meanings or virtues , and represent certain elements and precious stones . Even if this is an idea mostly disregarded by serious heraldists throughout the centuries , it may be of anecdotal interest to see what they are , since people often ask for this information . Many sources give different meanings , but the gules tincture is often said to represent the following : \n * of jewels , the ruby ; \n * of heavenly bodies , Mars . \n \n Etymology \n \n The term `` gules '' derives from the Old French word goules , literally meaning `` throats '' ( related to the English gullet ; modern French gueules ) , but also used to refer to a fur neckpiece , usually made of red fur . \n \n For many decades , heraldic authors have believed that the term may have arisen from the Persian word gol `` rose '' ( coming to Europe via Muslim Spain or brought back by returning Crusaders ) , but according to Brault there is no evidence to support this derivation .",

Citing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights articles 18 and 19 , it announced a campaign on `` Appeal for Amnesty , 1961 '' and called for `` common action '' . The article also launched the book Persecution 1961 and its stories of doctor Agostinho Neto , philosopher Constantin Noica , lawyer Antonio Amat and Ashton Jones and Patrick Duncan . \n \n Benenson reputedly wrote his article after having learnt that two Portuguese students from Coimbra were imprisoned in Portugal for raising a toast to freedom . The article was reprinted in newspapers across the world and provoked a flood of responses from the readers , marshalling groups in several countries to examine human rights abuses . \n \n While , in 2015 , the original story still remains to be verified , the appeal marks the beginning of Amnesty International , founded in London the same year following the publication after Benenson enlisted a Tory , a Liberal and a Labour MP .",

          "context": "An archipelago ( ) , sometimes called an island group or island chain , is a chain , cluster or collection of islands . The word archipelago is derived from the Greek ἄρχι- – arkhi- ( `` chief '' ) and πέλαγος – pélagos ( `` sea '' ) through the Italian arcipelago . In Italian , possibly following a tradition of antiquity , the Archipelago ( from medieval Greek * ἀρχιπέλαγος and Latin archipelagus ) was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and , later , usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands ( since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands ) . It is now used to refer to any island group or , sometimes , to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands . \n \n Types \n \n Archipelagos may be found isolated in large amounts of water or neighbouring a large land mass . For example , Scotland has more than 700 islands surrounding its mainland which form an archipelago . Archipelagos are often volcanic , forming along island arcs generated by subduction zones or hotspots , but may also be the result of erosion , deposition , and land elevation . Depending on their geological origin , islands forming archipelagos can be referred to as 'oceanic islands ' , 'continental fragments ' , and 'continental islands ' . Oceanic islands are mainly of volcanic origin . Continental fragments correspond to land masses that have separated from a continental mass due to tectonic displacement . Finally , sets of islands formed close to the coast of a continent are considered continental archipelagos when they form part of the same continental shelf so islands are just exposed continental shelf . \n \n Indonesia , Japan , the Philippines , New Zealand , Maldives , the British Isles , the Bahamas , Greece , Hawaii , Azores and New York City are examples of well-known archipelagos . The largest archipelagic state in the world by area and population is Indonesia . The archipelago with the most islands is the Swedish East Coast Archipelago , which contains the Stockholm Archipelago , which , in turn , connects to the world 's second largest archipelago , the Archipelago Sea in Finland .",

Many feed on plants , though some are carnivorous . Larval plant feeders ( such as the Hessian fly larva ) cause root , stem , or leaf galls to be formed by the host plant . Some species of fungus gnats ( families Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae ) are pests of mushrooms and roots of potted plants in homes and greenhouses . \n \n Some South American Pleurothallid orchids are pollinated by tiny gnats and have correspondingly small flowers .",

CABI publishing , Oxon , New York . \n \n This genus originated in Mesoamerica and was brought to the Caribbean Islands by the Carib natives . The oldest register with the representation of the fruit seems to be included in the Cascajal Block , attributed to the Olmec civilization . \n \n In 1493 , Christopher Columbus first saw plants of this genus in Guadeloupe . It was brought from Brazil to Europe by the Portuguese , and from there was distributed to the Pacific Islands by the Spanish and the English . Commercial pineapple plantations were established in Hawaii , the Philippines , Southeast Asia , Florida and Cuba . The pineapple has become one of the world 's most popular fruits . \n \n The tough leaves grow in large rosettes , arising basally from a crown . These leaves are long and lanceolate with a serrate or thorny margin . The flowers , arising from the heart of the rosette , each have their own sepals . They grow into a compact head on a short , robust stalk . The sepals become fleshy and juicy and develop into the well-known complex form of the pseudocarp fruit , crowned by a rosette of leaves . \n \n Ananas species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Batrachedra comosae , which feeds exclusively on A. comosus . \n \n The word Ananas is derived from the Guarani name for the pineapple , via Portuguese . In most languages , pineapple is called `` ananas '' . \n \n Chemistry \n \n Pineapples contain both bromelain and papain to which they owe their meat tenderizing properties . \n \n Ethnobotanical uses \n \n The fruit and roots are used by some peoples as anti-inflammatory , proteolytic agent , and a root decoction for diarrhea . \n \n Production \n \n The biggest producers in 2012 were the US ( 12.3 % ) , Thailand ( 11.4 % ) and the Philippines ( 10.9 % ) . \n \n Species \n \n # Ananas ananassoides ( Baker ) L.B .

Eureka ! is based on the North American model of children ’ s museums , aimed at families with children age 0–11 and encourages hands-on inter-generational learning . \n \n History \n \n Dame Vivien Duffield , Chair of the Clore Duffield Foundation , was inspired by the children 's museums that she saw during visits to the USA . Back at home she pursued her idea to create the UK ’ s very own children ’ s museum , and The Museum for Children was formally constituted as a registered charity in 1985 . Dame Vivien remains Eureka ! ’ s Life President . \n \n Eureka ! 's location was partly inspired by Prince Charles , who opened the museum on 9 July 1992 and subsequently become its Patron until 2002 . \n It is located on former British Rail land next to Halifax railway station . \n \n The building design was led by Ken Moth of Building Design Partnership , an international architectural practice , and the exhibition designs were produced by an in-house team and by design groups who pitched for various elements of the work – co-ordinated by Richard Fowler . Design groups included Imagination ( the Me and My Body gallery ) and Conran ( original gift shop ) and individuals included Tim Hunkin ( Archimedes ) and Satoshi Kitamura ( illustrations ) . \n \n Eureka ! celebrated its 20th birthday in 2012 by launching [ http : //www.play20.org/ Play 20 ] - an online resource providing play ideas and campaign to get parents , carers and their children playing together . \n \n Galleries \n \n The museum has four main galleries : \n * All About Me - Opened in March 2013 . A £2.9 Million gallery , lead funded by the Wellcome Trust , exploring the themes of health , well-being and the human body . \n * Living and Working Together - A miniature town square ( including a bank , fountain , garage and shops ) and house . \n * Our Global Garden - showcasing gardens from around the world : Town , Jungle , Ice , Ocean , Country . \n * SoundSpace - An interactive gallery encouraging children to discover the science of sound and music , with the help of Orby the Alien . \n \n The museum also has two galleries aimed at the under-fives : \n * SoundGarden \n * Desert Discovery \n \n The grounds of Eureka ! include : \n * The Beach - possibly the biggest outdoor sandpit in the North of England . \n * The Wonder Walk - An outdoor sensory trail . \n \n Projects \n \n * Helping Hands - A three-year project , funded by the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation , working to make Eureka ! fully accessible to families with disabled children . \n * Mission : Active Future - An interactive travelling exhibition designed to help children switch on to a healthier lifestyle .",

          "context": "Mr Whoppit was the teddy bear mascot of Donald Campbell , the land and water speed record holder . Writing in his 2011 book , Donald Campbell : The Man Behind The Mask , journalist David Tremayne described Whoppit as Campbell 's `` magic talisman '' . \n \n As was his father Sir Malcolm Campbell , Donald Campbell was highly superstitious . Both consulted spiritualist mediums and fortune tellers , Donald also placed his faith in a lucky mascot , Mr Whoppit . He refused to drive unless Whoppit was with him . One of his wife Tonia 's tasks was to hand Whoppit to him on entering the cockpit . Whoppit was noted in 2003 by reporter Frank Bennett as being part of the `` threesome '' arriving for the 1964 record run the others being Campbell himself , and his wife . Bennett remarked that the mascot was in the cockpit each time , along with other memorabilia . \n \n Whoppit was with Campbell during his serious crash during a land-speed record attempt at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1960 , driving the Proteus Bluebird . \n \n Campbell was killed during a record attempt on Coniston in 1967 , while driving the jet hydroplane Bluebird K7 . His body was n't recovered , although Mr Whoppit floated free and was found almost immediately by Leo Villa . Campbell 's body was finally located and recovered in 2001 . \n \n Campbell also named one of his dogs 'Whoppit ' . Another teddy bear mascot was found as a 'wife ' for Whoppit , named 'Mrs Whacko ' , who did not ride with Whoppit but stayed with Tonia and the pit crew . \n \n Mr Whoppit 's origins \n \n 'Woppit ' first appeared as a cartoon strip 'The story of Woppit ' about a toy teddy bear , from the first issue of the comic Robin in 1953 . In 1956 , Merrythought manufactured a 9-inch tall Woppit bear wearing a red felt jacket and one of these was given to Donald by his close friend and manager Peter Barker.On joining the Bluebird team , Woppit acquired a miniature of their `` Bluebird '' patch sewn to his jacket , later followed by a one-piece flight suit . His name also changed slightly to 'Mr Whoppit ' . In 1959 , both Campbell and Mr Whoppit were photographed together in Robin . \n \n In the late 1990s , Merrythought re-issued a limited production of 5,000 replicas of Mr Whoppit , with the original red jacket now sporting the Bluebird motif . \n \n With Gina Campbell \n \n In later years , Donald 's daughter Gina Campbell also adopted Whoppit as a mascot for her own water record-breaking attempts . These led to Whoppit 's third high-speed crash . \n \n In 1995 she offered him for auction , together with other Campbell memorabilia . He was to sell for about £60,000 but failed to reach the reserve and so remained in her possession . The decision to auction off Mr Whoppit was a cause of acrimony between Gina Campbell and Donald 's widow Tonia Bern-Campbell , which re-surfaced again during the recovery of Bluebird in 2001 .",

It is run at Ascot over a distance of 2 miles and 4 furlongs ( 4,023 metres ) , and it is scheduled to take place each year in June . \n \n It is Britain 's most prestigious event for `` stayers '' – horses which specialise in racing over long distances . It is traditionally held on day three of the Royal Ascot meeting , which is known colloquially ( but not officially ) as Ladies ' Day . Contrary to popular belief the actual title of the race does not include the word `` Ascot '' . In 2016 it will be run as `` the Gold Cup in Honour of The Queen 's 90th Birthday '' . \n \n History \n \n The event established in 1807 , and it was originally open to horses aged three or older . The inaugural winner , Master Jackey , was awarded prize money of 100 guineas . The first race took place in the presence of King George III and Queen Charlotte . \n \n The 1844 running was attended by Nicholas I of Russia , who was making a state visit to England . That year 's winner was unnamed at the time of his victory , but he was given the name `` The Emperor '' in honour of the visiting monarch . In return Nicholas offered a new trophy for the race — the `` Emperor 's Plate '' — and this became the title of the event for a short period . Its original name was restored after nine years , during the Crimean War . \n \n The Gold Cup is the first leg of Britain 's Stayers ' Triple Crown , followed by the Goodwood Cup and the Doncaster Cup . The last horse to win all three races in the same year was Double Trigger in 1995 . \n \n The Gold Cup is one of three perpetual trophies at the Royal Ascot meeting , along with the Royal Hunt Cup and the Queen 's Vase , which can be kept permanently by the winning owners . A number of horses have won it more than once , and the most successful is Yeats , who recorded his fourth victory in 2009 . \n \n Records \n \n Most successful horse ( 4 wins ) : \n * Yeats – 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 \n \n Leading jockey ( 11 wins ) : \n * Lester Piggott – Zarathustra ( 1957 ) , Gladness ( 1958 ) , Pandofell ( 1961 ) , Twilight Alley ( 1963 ) , Fighting Charlie ( 1965 ) , Sagaro ( 1975 , 1976 , 1977 ) , Le Moss ( 1979 ) , Ardross ( 1981 , 1982 ) \n \n Leading trainer ( 7 wins ) : \n \n * Aidan O'Brien – Yeats ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 ) , Fame and Glory ( 2011 ) , Leading Light ( 2014 ) , Order of St George ( 2016 ) \n \n Leading owner ( 7 wins ) : ( includes part ownership ) \n \n * Sue Magnier – Yeats ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 ) , Fame and Glory ( 2011 ) , Leading Light ( 2014 ) , Order of St George ( 2016 ) \n \n Winners \n \n The race was abandoned in 1964 because of waterlogging \n \n Rock Roi finished first in 1971 and 1972 , but he was disqualified both times \n \n Royal Gait was first in 1988 , but he was relegated to last place following a stewards ' inquiry \n \n The 2005 running took place at York \n \n * The race was run at Newmarket during the wartime periods of 1917–18 and 1941–44 .",

For the December 21 , 1913 , edition , he introduced a puzzle with a diamond shape and a hollow center , the letters F-U-N already being filled in . He called it a `` Word-Cross Puzzle . '' \n \n Although Wynne 's invention was based on earlier puzzle forms , such as the word diamond , he introduced a number of innovations ( e.g . the use of horizontal and vertical lines to create boxes for solvers to enter letters ) . He subsequently pioneered the use of black squares in a symmetrical arrangement to separate words in rows and columns . With the exception of the numbering scheme , the form of Wynne 's `` Word-Cross '' puzzles is that used for modern crosswords . \n \n A few weeks after the first `` Word-Cross '' appeared , the name of the puzzle was changed to `` Cross-Word '' as a result of a typesetting error .

Although the word is mostly used to refer to any kind of dough , in some regions ( Mexico , parts of Central America and the American South West ) it is often short for masa de maíz , a maize ( corn ) dough made from freshly prepared hominy . It is used for making corn tortillas , tamales , pupusas , and many other Latin American dishes . The dried and powdered form is called masa harina , masa de harina , and sometimes Maseca , the name of a leading commercial brand . It is reconstituted with water before use . Masa is not to be confused with masarepa , masa de arepa , or masa al instante , a type of unnixtamalized , soaked , and cooked cornmeal used to make arepas . Masa de trigo is Spanish for wheat flour dough . It is also used for making wheat tortillas and other breads and pastries . \n \n To make hominy , field corn ( maize ) grain is dried and then treated by soaking and cooking the mature ( hard ) grain in a diluted solution of slaked lime ( calcium hydroxide ) or wood ash , a process termed nixtamalization . Lime and ash are highly alkaline : the alkalinity helps the dissolution of hemicellulose , the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls , and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the corn . Some of the corn oil is broken down into emulsifying agents ( monoglycerides and diglycerides ) , while bonding of the corn proteins to each other is also facilitated . The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains . As a result , while cornmeal made from untreated ground corn is unable by itself to form a dough on addition of water , the chemical changes in masa allow dough formation , which is essential to the ability to fashion dough into tortillas . \n \n Finally , in addition to providing a source of dietary calcium , the lime reacts with the corn so that the nutrient niacin can be absorbed by the digestive tract . While consumption of untreated corn is a risk factor in predisposition to pellagra , as in African countries , the risk is dramatically reduced or eliminated by nixtamalization . The soaked maize is washed , and then ground into masa . When fresh masa is dried and powdered , it becomes masa seca or masa harina . \n \n The process of making hominy is also called nixtamalization and the ground product can be called masa nixtamalera . In Central American and Mexican cuisine , masa nixtamalera is cooked with water and milk to make a thick , gruel-like beverage called atole . When made with chocolate and sugar , it becomes atole de chocolate . Adding anise and piloncillo to this mix creates champurrado , a popular breakfast drink .",

The story is about a 10-year-old boy living in Barrytown , North Dublin , and the events that happen within his age group , school and home in around 1968 . \n \n Language and plot structure \n \n The novel is known for its interesting use of language – Doyle uses a register that gives the reader the vivid impression of listening to a ten-year-old Irish boy from the 1960s . The novel is not divided into chapters but into small scenes which do not follow any chronological order . \n \n The plot structure of the novel is also unconventional , that of numerous vignettes . Despite the absence of a clear-cut plot ( introduction , complication , climax , dénouement ) one can still , with certain sensitivities in place , derive a perceptible passing of time as we witness , gradually , how Barrytown changes . \n \n The novel , chronicling Paddy 's internal journey towards maturity , is a bildungsroman as it centres around the main character 's development . Paddy 's growing up is painfully bitter . While the beginning of the book is filled with playful antics , the growing antagonism between his parents and the breaking up of their marriage are evident as the novel moves on . What makes Paddy 's rite of passage , as it were , all the more tragic is the fact that he does not choose his `` journey of enlightenment and maturity '' , rather , he is robbed of it when his parents become estranged from one another . \n \n Plot synopsis \n \n Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha recounts ( approximately ) one year in the life of a Dublin ten-year-old , Patrick `` Paddy '' Clarke , especially his relationships with Sinbad ( Francis ) , his younger brother , his parents and his schoolmates and teachers . It begins with him being a mischievous boy roaming around local Barrytown and ends with his father departing from the family , forcing the boy to take up adult responsibilities in his now single-parent home .",

          "context": "Fountains of Rome ( Italian : Fontane di Roma ) is a symphonic poem written by the Italian composer Ottorino Respighi . It is the first orchestral work in his `` Roman trilogy '' , followed by Pines of Rome ( 1924 ) and Roman Festivals ( 1928 ) . Each of the four movements depict one of Rome ’ s fountains at different times of the day . Its premiere was held on March 11 , 1917 at the Teatro Augusteo in Rome under the direction of Antonio Guarnieri . \n \n Structure \n \n The first section , The Fountain of Valle Giulia at Dawn ( La fontana di Valle Giulia all'Alba ) , shows this fountain at daybreak in a pastoral landscape which cattle pass through during the morning . \n \n In the second section , The Triton Fountain in the Morning ( La fontana del Tritone al mattino ) , depicts Naiads and Tritons dancing in the morning light , as figures of the Bernini fountain are seen nearby . Gods and goddesses using conch shells are portrayed by the French horn . \n \n The third section , The Trevi Fountain at Noon ( La fontana di Trevi al meriggio ) , is ushered in by a triumph giving news of a recent victory by the god Neptune . \n \n The final section , The Villa Medici Fountain at Sunset ( La fontana di Villa Medici al tramonto ) , portrays a much more melancholic atmosphere , as the brilliance of the sun fades . \n \n Instrumentation \n \n Fountains of Rome calls for the following large orchestra : \n \n * woodwinds : piccolo , 2 flutes , 2 oboes , English horn , 2 clarinets in B-flat and A , bass clarinet in B-flat and A , 2 bassoons \n * brass : 4 French horns in F , 3 trumpets in B-flat and A , 3 trombones , tuba \n * percussion : timpani , cymbals , triangle , bell in D , glockenspiel \n * keyboards : organ ( ad lib . ) , piano , celesta \n * strings : 2 harps , violins i , ii , violas , violoncellos , double basses \n \n It was also transcribed for piano duet by the composer . \n \n Performances and Recordings \n \n Arturo Toscanini originally planned to conduct the work in 1916 , but the Italian composer refused to appear for the performance after a disagreement over his having included some of Wagner 's music on a program played during World War I. Consequently , it did not premiere until March 11 , 1917 at the Teatro Augusteo in Rome with Antonio Guarnieri as conductor . Although the premiere was unsuccessful , Toscanini finally conducted the work in Milan in 1918 with tremendous success . \n \n The piece was first performed in the United States on February 13 , 1919 . Toscanini recorded the music with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall in 1951 ; the high fidelity recording was issued on LP and then digitally remastered for release on CD by RCA Victor . The work has since become one of the most eminent examples of the symphonic poem .",

His father , Christoph , who worked in a shoe factory , and the Zehlein brothers , who produced the spikes for track shoes in their smithy , supported Dassler in starting his own business . On 1 July 1924 , his older brother Rudolf joined the business , which became the Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ( Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory ) . \n \n At the 1928 Olympics , Dassler equipped many athletes , laying the foundation for the international expansion of the company . During the 1936 Olympics in Berlin , he equipped the African-American athlete Jesse Owens who went on to win four gold medals . \n \n With the rise of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s , both Dassler brothers joined the Nazi Party , with Rudolf reputed as being the more ardent National Socialist . \n \n Adolf served the Wehrmacht at the beginning of the war for one year on the west front . Rudolf was drafted in March 1943 fighting the red army in the east , and was captured in April 1945 by the Gestapo for Absence Without Leave . On the way to Dachau concentration camp , so the legend goes , he was freed by US troops , only to be imprisoned again as a POW in Hammelburg . \n \n Adi had stayed behind to produce boots for the Wehrmacht and then broke away from the Nazi Party . The war exacerbated the differences between the brothers and their wives . Rudolf , upon his capture by American troops , was suspected of being a member of the SS , information supposedly supplied by his brother Adi . \n \n By 1948 , the rift between the brothers widened . Rudolf left the company to found Puma on the other side of town ( across the Aurach River ) , and Adolf Dassler renamed the company Adidas after his own nickname ( Adi Dassler ) . \n \n In 1973 , Adolf Dassler 's son Horst Dassler founded Arena , a producer of swimming equipment . After Adolf Dassler 's death in 1978 , Horst and his wife Käthe took over the management . Horst died nine years later , in 1987 . \n Adidas was transformed into a private limited company in 1989 , but remained family property until its IPO in 1995 . \n \n In 2006 , a sculpture of Dassler was unveiled in the Adi Dassler Stadium in Herzogenaurauch . It was created by the artist .",

Out of its 40 stories , `` eight-and-twenty '' , according to Kipling 's Preface , were initially published in the Civil and Military Gazette in Lahore , Punjab , British India , between November 1886 and June 1887 . `` The remaining tales are , more or less , new .

Not all of the stories are , in fact , about life in `` the Hills '' : Kipling gives sketches of many aspects of life in British India . \n \n The tales include the first appearances , in book form , of Mrs. Hauksbee , the policeman Strickland , and the Soldiers Three ( Privates Mulvaney , Ortheris and Learoyd ) . \n \n The stories \n \n * '' Lispeth '' \n * '' Three and - an Extra '' \n * '' Thrown Away '' \n * '' Miss Youghal 's Sais '' \n * '' Yoked with an Unbeliever ' '' \n * '' False Dawn '' \n * '' The Rescue of Pluffles '' \n * '' Cupid 's Arrows '' \n * '' The Three Musketeers '' \n * '' His Chance in Life '' \n * '' Watches of the Night '' \n * '' The Other Man '' \n * '' Consequences '' \n * '' The Conversion of Aurelian McGoggin '' \n * '' The Taking of Lungtungpen '' \n * '' A Germ-Destroyer '' \n * '' Kidnapped '' \n * '' The Arrest of Lieutenant Golightly '' \n * '' In the House of Suddhoo '' \n * '' His Wedded Wife '' \n * '' The Broken Link Handicap '' \n * '' Beyond the Pale '' \n * '' In Error '' \n * '' A Bank Fraud '' \n * '' Tods ' Amendment '' \n * '' The Daughter of the Regiment '' \n * '' In the Pride of his Youth '' \n * '' Pig '' \n * '' The Rout of the White Hussars '' \n * '' The Bronckhorst Divorce-case '' \n * '' Venus Annodomini '' \n * '' The Bisara of Pooree '' \n * '' A Friend 's Friend '' \n * '' The Gate of the Hundred Sorrows '' \n * '' The Madness of Private Ortheris '' \n * '' The Story of Muhammad Din '' \n * '' On the Strength of a Likeness '' \n * '' Wressley of the Foreign Office '' \n * '' By Word of Mouth '' \n * '' To be Filed for Reference '' \n \n Some of the characters in these stories reappear in the novel Kim .",

The smallest are credit-card or key sized units designed for carrying in a wallet or on a keyring , but others are designed to be carried in a trouser pocket or belt-mounted pouch . \n \n Historical \n \n The idea of incorporating several tools in one small portable unit is very old , dating back at least as far as Middle Roman times . Many of these were based around eating . \n \n Pocket knives \n \n Among the earliest contemporary examples is the Swiss Army knife as supplied by makers Victorinox and Wenger . The actual version supplied to the Swiss army includes a knife blade , a reamer , a bottle-opener–screwdriver–wire stripper , and a can-opener–screwdriver . Besides Victorinox and Wenger , many other manufacturers now make similar knives . \n \n Other versions may include items like a nail file , tweezers , folding scissors , a tooth pick , a magnifying glass , screwdriver bits and others . There are also versions that have special tools for specific sports or outdoor activities like golf , horseback riding , hunting or fishing . Versions intended for cyclists may have a selection of allen ( hex ) keys , a selection of wrenches , screwdrivers , a spoke key , and a chain-breaker . \n \n Models like the Wenger SwissGrip , Wenger Pocketgrip , Al Mar 4x4 , SOG ToolClip , Snap-on and CRKT Zilla-Tool are similar in style . \n \n Folding multi-tools \n \n In 1983 Tim Leatherman sold his first `` Pocket Survival Tool '' , larger and more robust than a pocket-knife based tool , and incorporating a set of needle-nosed pliers in a balisong-style mechanism . Too large for most pockets , it came with a belt pouch . Today , Leatherman Tool Group manufactures and markets a variety of multi-tool models . \n \n `` Leatherman '' is now often treated as a genericized trademark for the similar multi-tools now available from makers such as Coleman , Gerber , Kershaw Knives , Schrade , SOG Knife , Victorinox , Craftsman - along with many unbranded types produced in low-cost production regions , and smaller mini and micro units are often small enough for pockets or even key rings . \n \n Other multi-tools \n \n In recent years , a number of urban and outdoor multi-tools have sprouted offering non-traditional tools one would not expect to find in a single unit . \n \n Substituting a toolbox , these multi-tools functions include a hammer , spirit level , camera tripod , LED light , lighter , tape measure and an assortment of screwdriver bits .",

During the 19th century , it was a popular destination for daytrippers taking advantage of easy access using the newly constructed North Staffordshire Railway . The lake is still used for many water activities such as boating , canoeing , fishing and also for walks and recreational steam train trips . \n \n History \n \n The village of Rudyard was named after Ralph Rudyard , a local man reputed to have killed Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field . Rudyard Lake was constructed by the engineer John Rennie , for the Trent and Mersey Canal company in 1797–98 to feed the Caldon Canal . \n \n On 26 June 1846 the North Staffordshire Railway successfully took over the canal company and lake as part of one of its acts of parliament that resulted in the formation of the North Staffordshire Railway . Having acquired the lake and the land around it the railway used the land down one side as the route for its Churnet Valley Line between Macclesfield and Uttoxeter . Two stations were built , one at Rudyard village ( later renamed Rudyard Lake ) and one at the north end of the lake called Rudyard Lake ( later renamed Cliffe Park ) \n \n Because of the accessibility brought by the railway stations , daytrippers and tourists began visiting the lake . Visitors included John Lockwood Kipling and Alice Macdonald , the parents of Rudyard Kipling , who met there on a trip from Burslem . They liked the place so much they named their son after it . By the end of the 19th century up to 20,000 people visited the lake each day . Matthew Webb entertained crowds by demonstrating his swimming in the lake , and Carlos Trower ( the African Blondin ) performed a tightrope walk across the lake . \n \n Attractions \n \n The lake is home to Rudyard Lake Sailing Club and North Staffordshire Rowing Club . Fishing , walking , canoeing and boat trips are popular attractions . The lake has a visitor centre , toilets and an activity centre which can be hired for functions or conferences . An annual lake festival is held on a Sunday in August and a firework display takes place in November . \n \n The Rudyard Lake Steam Railway runs narrow gauge steam trains that operate up the east side of the lake on many days throughout the year . It is possible to walk round the lake or walk part way and start/finish the journey by steam train . \n \n Top Gear episode \n \n The BBC 's motoring show Top Gear held a challenge at the lake in 2006 to see which presenter had designed the best amphibious car . Richard Hammond 's attempt sank while Jeremy Clarkson 's attempt capsized with Richard on board at the end of the challenge . However , James May 's Triumph Herald , complete with sail and mast , performed well , despite the almost total absence of wind , and he was able to drive it out of the water , thus winning the challenge .",

The work was inspired by Rowlandson 's print depicting Portsmouth Point . Walton recalled that the main musical had come into his mind whilst riding on a route 22 bus in London . Walton dedicated the score to the poet Siegfried Sassoon , who had recommended that Oxford University Press publish the score . The score was first published in piano-duet form in 1925 . The full orchestral score was published in 1928 . \n \n The overture was selected for performance at the 1926 International Society for Contemporary Music festival , and received its first performance in Zürich on 22 June 1926 , conducted by Volkmar Andreae . The first London performance was on 28 June 1926 , with Eugene Goossens conducting the overture as an interval work in the midst of a Diaghilev ballet performance . Walton himself conducted the overture at The Proms in 1927 . Constant Lambert later prepared a version of the overture , with a reduced orchestration , from Walton 's original , and also with simplified time signatures . Lambert first conducted this version in 1932 . \n \n Portsmouth Point depicts in musical form the rumbustious life of British 18th century sailors . Commentators have noted the influence of Igor Stravinsky 's music and of jazz in the rhythms of the score , as well as the rhythm of the Catalonian sardana dance . \n \n In 1953 , Walton briefly quoted this work in his contribution to the collaborative work Variations on an Elizabethan Theme .",

It was released on the Blue Rock label ( 4014 ) in May 1965 with `` Sir Mack Rice '' as the artist . The song uses an AAB layout with a 24-bar structure . \n \n It gained greater popularity when Wilson Pickett covered it the following year on a single , a version that was also released on the 1966 album , The Wicked Pickett . Also in 1966 , John Lee Hooker recorded an entirely different song with a similar title — `` Mustang Sally & GTO '' . \n \n History \n \n According to music historian Tom Shannon the song started as a joke when singer Della Reese wanted a new Ford Mustang . Rice called the early version `` Mustang Mama '' but changed the title after Aretha Franklin suggested `` Mustang Sally '' . \n \n On The Rascals Anthology booklet , Felix Cavaliere claims The Young Rascals actually recorded `` Mustang Sally '' and `` Land of a Thousand Dances '' before Pickett . He says Atlantic Records `` copped those two songs from them and gave them to Pickett '' to record . \n \n Popular versions \n \n Rice 's version made it to # 15 on the U.S. R & B charts in 1965 . Pickett 's version climbed to # 6 on the R & B charts and # 23 on the Pop charts in 1966 , # 4 in Canada on the ( RPM ) charts , and # 28 in the UK Singles Chart on its original release and # 62 , when it was released again in 1987 . \n \n In 2004 , Rolling Stone ranked Wilson Pickett 's recording of the song at # 434 on a list of Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . The song dropped seven spots to # 441 , when the magazine published its 2010 update of the list . \n \n Popular culture and covers \n \n The Young Rascals covered the song in 1966 , changing the year of the `` brand new Mustang '' from 1965 to 1966 . \n \n The chorus of the song includes the lyrics `` ride , Sally , ride '' — a phrase that became fodder for newspaper headlines in 1983 , when astronaut Sally Ride became the first American woman in space . The Lou Reed song `` Ride Sally Ride '' , which quotes these lyrics throughout , is the first track on his 1974 album Sally Ca n't Dance . The same lyric is found in `` Dance to the Music '' by Sly and the Family Stone in 1968 and in the children 's song `` Sally the Camel '' . \n \n The song featured prominently in the 1991 film The Commitments and appears on the film 's soundtrack album , sung by Andrew Strong . It was released as a single from the album and reached # 63 in the UK Singles Chart , # 43 on the Australian charts and # 17 on the New Zealand charts . Also in 1991 Chicago blues legend Buddy Guy teamed with English guitarist Jeff Beck for a version of the song on Guy ’ s album `` Damn Right I ’ ve Got The Blues '' . \n \n As the song primarily mentions the car , it became synonymous with the Ford Mustang .",

They are found from the Indian Subcontinent across Southeast Asia to Australia . \n \n Biology \n \n They are named for their large flattened hooked bill and huge frog-like gape , which they use to capture insects . Their flight is weak . They rest horizontally on branches during the day , camouflaged by their cryptic plumage . Up to three white eggs are laid in the fork of a branch , and are incubated by the female at night and the male in the day . The three Podargus species are large frogmouths restricted to Australia and New Guinea , that have massive flat broad bills . They are known to take larger prey such as small vertebrates ( frogs , mice , etc . ) , which are sometimes beaten against a stone before swallowing . The ten Batrachostomus frogmouths are found in tropical Asia . They have smaller , more rounded bills and are predominantly insectivorous . Both Podargus and Batrachostomus have bristles around the base of the bill , and Batrachostomus has other , longer bristles which may exist to protect the eyes from insect prey . In April 2007 , a new species of frogmouth was described from the Solomon Islands and placed in a newly established genus , Rigidipenna . \n \n Taxonomy \n \n Recent research suggests that the two frogmouth groups may not be as closely related as previously thought , and that the Asian species may be separable as a new family , the Batrachostomidae .

As a young musician , Bunnell was inspired by The Beatles and The Beach Boys . \n \n While attending London Central High School in England he met Gerry Beckley and Dan Peek . After an initial attempt at forming a band in the late 1960s , the trio formed America in 1969 and released their first album in 1971 . \n \n As with the other members , Bunnell wrote , sang and played guitar . His best-known compositions include `` A Horse with No Name '' , `` Ventura Highway '' , and `` Tin Man '' . Bunnell has explained that `` A Horse with No Name '' was `` a metaphor for a vehicle to get away from life 's confusion into a quiet , peaceful place '' , while `` Sandman '' was inspired by his casual talks with returning Vietnam veterans . Afraid that they might be attacked and killed in their sleep , many of them chose to stay awake as long as possible , either naturally or with pharmaceuticals . Thus , they were `` running from the Sandman . '' \n \n In 1973 he moved to Marin County , California , with his then-wife , Vivien . They divorced in 1999 and he married Penny in 2002 . The two split their time between homes in Palos Verdes and northern Wisconsin , where Penny is from . \n \n Bunnell is still a member of America , along with founding member Gerry Beckley . America has made more than 20 albums of original material , along with a number of hits compilations , between the 1960s and the present . America 's album , Back Pages was released on 26 July 2011 . The group was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 2012 .

It was written by band member Dewey Bunnell and produced by George Martin , who also plays the piano part on the recorded version . The song was included on the band 's album Holiday , also from 1974 . \n \n Background \n \n The song 's title and some of its lyrics refer to the Tin Woodman from The Wizard of Oz . Songwriter Bunnell was quoted describing the parallel : `` My favorite movie , I guess . I always loved it as a kid . Very obscure lyrics . Great grammar - 'Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man . ' It 's sort of a poetic license . '' \n \n Dan Peek - who describes `` Tin Man '' as `` quintessential Dewey , easy stream of consciousness with a major seventh acoustic bed '' - states that Bunnell `` actually begged us not to record the song . Knowing Dewey it was probably reverse psychology ; if it was , Gerry and I fell for it , insisting it was perfect for the album . '' \n \n Released as the first single from Holiday , `` Tin Man '' became the band 's fourth top-ten hit in the US , spending three weeks at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1974 . The song reached number one on the Billboard easy listening chart in October of that year . In the UK , the song was relegated to the B-side of another album track , `` Mad Dog '' , released in July , but both sides failed to chart . \n \n Charts \n \n Cover versions \n \n A Finnish rendering of `` Tin Man '' entitled `` Toisin käy '' was recorded by Finnish band Cascade in 1974 .

The British links-style course is owned by Pierce County and opened for play on June 23 , 2007 . The course hosted the 2015 U.S. Open . \n \n Design \n \n Chambers Bay was designed by Robert Trent Jones , Jr . The 250 acre course is the centerpiece of a 930 acre county park . Pierce County bought the land for $ 33 million in 1992 ; the property was formerly a sand-and-gravel quarry , popular with off-road four-wheelers and dirt-bikers . \n \n Construction \n \n During construction , 1.4 million cubic yards ( 1.1 million m³ ) of dirt and sand ( over 100,000 truckloads ) were removed , cleaned off site , and returned to sculpt the course . At the time , it was still permitted as a working mine , which meant fewer restrictions for the course architects . \n \n Layout \n \n Five sets of tees are available , ranging from 5250 to , and as a municipal course , Pierce County residents receive discounted rates . The course is for walkers only , caddies are available but are optional . Motorized carts are permitted only for those with medical conditions or disabilities , and a caddie must be hired as the driver . \n \n The greens do not have fringes - it is a transparent transition from fairway to green . \n \n Card of the course \n \n Championship Tees \n \n Navy Tees \n \n Source : \n \n Chambers Bay has just one tree , a Douglas fir behind the 15th green . \n \n Operation \n \n The course is operated by Kemper Sports Management of Northbrook , Illinois , which also operates Bandon Dunes on the southern Oregon coast . \n \n The course is part of the Chambers Creek Properties which includes numerous non-golf recreational opportunities including a three mile loop ( 5 km ) walking trail , part of which travels through the west side of the golf course . \n \n Events \n \n Chambers Bay was the site of the U.S . Amateur in 2010 and hosted the U.S. Open in 2015 ; these events were awarded by the United States Golf Association ( USGA ) in early 2008 . Chambers Bay was set as a par-71 at 7742 yd for the U.S . Amateur in 2010 , the longest course in USGA history . The record only lasted until the following year when Erin Hills surpassed it by 18 yards . \n \n Eleven months prior to the event , the USGA announced in July 2014 that all final round tickets and weekly ticket passes for the 2015 U.S. Open were sold out . The tournament was eventually won by Jordan Spieth . \n \n Criticism \n \n During the 2015 U.S. Open , Chambers Bay was subject to criticism for its bumpy greens , unfair course design , and poor accessibility for spectators . Former U.S. Open champion Gary Player called it `` the worst golf course I might ’ ve ever seen in the 63 years as a professional golfer '' , and Henrik Stenson said that the greens were like `` putting on broccoli '' .",

The child was to be dedicated from the womb as a Nazirite , which entailed restrictions on his diet , which the angel spelled out in detail . The woman ( whose name is not mentioned in the Bible ) told her husband , `` A man of God came to me '' . Manoah prayed and the angel returned to instruct the both of them . After the angel left , Manoah tells his wife , `` We shall surely die , because we have seen God . '' \n \n Together with his wife , Manoah subsequently tried to dissuade Samson from marrying a Philistine woman , but traveled with him to Timnah for the wedding ceremony when they were unable to do so . \n \n Samson 's birth has special importance for some Christians ( primarily Catholics ) , because of its similarity to the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary . \n \n After Samson 's death , his family recovers his body and buries him near the tomb of Manoah . \n \n In culture \n \n * In 1914 American film Samson , Manoah was played by George Periolat , while his wife was played by Lule Warrenton . \n * In 1996 film Samson and Delilah , Manoah , played by Paul Freeman , is shown as a poor old man .

Before its conversion in 2008-2012 it was a restaurant and meeting place . \n \n History \n \n The establishment was originally conceived and set up in 1865 by Daniel Nicholas Thévenon , who was a French wine merchant . He had to flee France due to bankruptcy , arriving in Britain in 1863 with his wife , Célestine , and just five pounds in cash . He changed his name to Daniel Nicols . Under his son , also named Daniel Nicols , the Café Royal flourished and was considered at one point to have the greatest wine cellar in the world . Daniel Nicols then married and had two children , Roy Daniel Nicols and Patricia Nicols . \n \n By the 1890s the Café Royal had become the place to see and be seen at . Its patrons have included Oscar Wilde , Aleister Crowley , Virginia Woolf , D.H. Lawrence , Winston Churchill , Noël Coward , Brigitte Bardot , Max Beerbohm , George Bernard Shaw , Jacob Epstein , Mick Jagger , Elizabeth Taylor , Muhammad Ali and Diana , Princess of Wales . \n \n The café was the scene of a famous meeting on 24 March 1895 , when Frank Harris advised Oscar Wilde to drop his charge of criminal libel against the Marquess of Queensberry , father of Alfred Douglas . Queensberry was acquitted , and Wilde was subsequently tried , convicted and imprisoned . \n \n From 1951 , the Café Royal was the home of the National Sporting Club . It was bought by David Locke in 1972 . \n \n Restoration and conversion \n \n The Café Royal closed in December 2008 . The fittings and furniture were later sold at auction . \n The building is a grade II listed building , which will protect its architecturally significant features and fixtures . \n \n There is also the `` N '' symbol , which represents `` Nicols '' to remind visitors of the foundation and history behind the set-up of this place . \n \n But according to the concierge , the son of Nicols who had the `` N '' symbol put in place , did it in commemoration of Napoleon . Indeed every amateur of Napoleon will recognize the blason immediately . The father Nicols thought for a while that it was an hommage to him and was not very happy when he understood what the `` N '' really stood for . \n \n David Chipperfield Architects restored and transformed the building into a hotel with 159 rooms and historic suites , an array of dining rooms , a club , meeting rooms and a wellbeing spa and gym with 18-metre pool . Alrov Properties , a subsidiary of the Israeli Alrov Group , opened the hotel in December 2012 .",

For information on the Symphony No . 3 with organ by Camille Saint-Saëns , see Symphony No . 3 ( Saint-Saëns ) . \n \n An organ symphony is a piece for solo pipe organ in various movements . It is a symphonic genre , not so much in musical form ( in which it is more similar to the organ sonata or suite ) , but in imitating orchestral tone color , texture , and symphonic process . \n \n Though the very first organ symphony was written by German composer Wilhelm Valentin Volckmar in 1867 , the genre is mainly associated with French romanticism . César Franck wrote what is considered to be the first French organ symphony in his Grand pièce symphonique , and the composers Charles-Marie Widor , who wrote ten organ symphonies , and his pupil Louis Vierne , who wrote six , continued to cultivate the genre . Modern composers such as Aaron Copland and Jean Guillou have written organ symphonies as well . The genre is considered to have been brought to fruition in the second organ symphony of André Fleury .",

He was shot and killed by Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar public house in Whitechapel , east London . Kray was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder three years later and remained in Broadmoor Hospital until his death in 1995 . \n \n History \n \n Cornell hailed from east London and was originally known as George Myers but had changed his surname some years earlier . Cornell was a tough , loyal enforcer who worked for the Richardson Gang ; he was known for being totally fearless . A childhood friend of the Kray twins , Cornell was a prominent criminal in east London during the 1960s and upon moving to South London joined up with the Kray twins ' rivals , the Richardson Gang , who were brothers Charlie Richardson and Eddie Richardson . \n \n Cornell , along with Richardson gang colleague and friend `` Mad '' Frankie Fraser , became an enforcer for the Richardsons and was primarily used by them for talks with the Krays . Meetings were often held in pubs such as The Grave Maurice . \n \n Death \n \n On 9 March 1966 , Cornell and his friend Albie Woods entered the Blind Beggar pub , ordered some light ales and then sat upon stools next to the bar . At around 8:30pm , both men were approached by Ronnie Kray ; on seeing him , Cornell sneered with sarcasm `` Look who 's here '' . Ronnie Kray walked towards Cornell , took out a 9 mm Luger , and calmly shot him once in the forehead , just above his right eye . \n \n Cornell slumped against a nearby pillar , the bullet , apparently , passing straight through him . He was taken to a nearby hospital , where he died at around 03:30am . \n \n The news spread rapidly . Although Ronnie Kray was identified by several eyewitnesses as he calmly left the public house , no one would agree to testify against him and the police were forced to release him from custody . Cornell was buried in Camberwell New Cemetery , south London . \n \n Old Bailey trial \n \n On 4 March 1969 Ronnie Kray was unanimously found guilty by a jury at The Old Bailey of the murder of George Cornell . His brother Reggie was also found guilty of murdering Jack McVitie , who was killed the year after Cornell . They were both sentenced to life imprisonment . \n \n Ronnie Kray died in jail in March 1995 , while Reggie Kray was imprisoned for a total of 32 years before he was released from custody on compassionate grounds in August 2000 as a result of cancer , from which he died a few weeks after his release .",

It is roughly cubical in shape , and presents a prominence in its inferior ( or plantar ) surface , the tuberosity of the cuboid . The bone provides a groove where the tendon of the peroneus longus muscle passes to reach its insertion in the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform bones . \n \n Surfaces \n \n The dorsal surface , directed upward and lateralward , is rough , for the attachment of ligaments . \n \n The plantar surface presents in front a deep groove , the peroneal sulcus , which runs obliquely forward and medialward ; it lodges the tendon of the peroneus longus , and is bounded behind by a prominent ridge , to which the long plantar ligament is attached . \n \n The ridge ends laterally in an eminence , the tuberosity , the surface of which presents an oval facet ; on this facet glides the sesamoid bone or cartilage frequently found in the tendon of the peroneus longus . The surface of bone behind the groove is rough , for the attachment of the plantar calcaneocuboid ligament , a few fibers of the flexor hallucis brevis , and a fasciculus from the tendon of the tibialis posterior . \n \n The lateral surface presents a deep notch formed by the commencement of the peroneal sulcus . \n \n The posterior surface is smooth , triangular , and concavo-convex , for articulation with the anterior surface of the calcaneus ( the calcaneocuboid joint ) ; its infero-medial angle projects backward as a process which underlies and supports the anterior end of the calcaneus . \n \n The anterior surface , of smaller size , but also irregularly triangular , is divided by a vertical ridge into two facets , forming the fourth and fifth tarsometatarsal joints : the medial facet , quadrilateral in form , articulates with the fourth metatarsal ; the lateral , larger and more triangular , articulates with the fifth . \n \n The medial surface is broad , irregularly quadrilateral , and presents at its middle and upper part a smooth oval facet , for articulation with the third cuneiform ; and behind this ( occasionally ) a smaller facet , for articulation with the navicular bone ; it is rough in the rest of its extent , for the attachment of strong interosseous ligaments . \n \n Muscle attachments \n \n Only one muscle is attached to the cuboid bone ; the tibialis posterior . The tibialis posterior inserts to the under surface of the cuboid bone . While the flexor hallucis brevis arises , by a pointed tendinous process , from the medial part of the under surface of the cuboid bone , from the contiguous portion of the lateral cuneiform bone , and from the prolongation of the tendon of the tibialis posterior . \n \n Clinical significance \n \n In a condition known as cuboid syndrome , the cuboid can be subluxated downward causing a swollen kind of ache along the central portion of the lateral border of the foot .",

This small passerine bird is strongly migratory , and winters in tropical Africa , Arabia , and Pakistan . \n \n This is one of several Sylvia species that has distinct male and female plumages . Both sexes are mainly brown above and buff below , with chestnut fringes to the secondary remiges . The adult male has a grey head and a white throat . The female lacks the grey head , and the throat is duller . The whitethroat 's song is fast and scratchy , with a scolding tone . \n \n The hoarse , a little bit nasal call sounds like wed-wed or woid-woid . The warning cry is long-pulled , rough tschehr which resembles that of the Dartford warbler . \n \n This species may appear to be closely related to the lesser whitethroat , the species having evolved only during the end of the last ice age similar to the willow warbler and chiffchaffs . However , researchers found the presence of a white throat is an unreliable morphological marker for relationships in Sylvia , and the greater and lesser whitethroats are not closely related .

The two were primary members in Squeeze and Difford & Tilbrook . According to Difford , he stole 50p from his mother ’ s purse in order to put a card in a local sweetshop window advertising for a guitarist to join his band , although he didn ’ t actually have one at the time . Tilbrook was the only person who responded to the advert and they met for the first time shortly afterwards . Some of their best-known songs are `` Tempted '' , `` Pulling Mussels ( From the Shell ) '' , `` Black Coffee in Bed '' , `` Cool for Cats '' , `` Up the Junction '' and `` Annie Get Your Gun '' . \n \n After the breakup of Squeeze in 1983 Difford continued writing songs with Glenn Tilbrook for artists such as Jools Holland , Helen Shapiro , Billy Bremner and Elvis Costello . He has also written lyrics for music by Jools Holland , Elton John , Wet Wet Wet , Marti Pellow and others . He was involved with Tilbrook and John Turner in the creation of a musical , Labeled with Love , which was created using the songs of Squeeze . The 1983 musical performed in Deptford was short-lived . In 1984 the pair released the album Difford and Tilbrook and had a minor hit in the UK with Love 's Crashing Waves which reached 57 in the UK charts . In 1985 Squeeze reunited , having hits in the U.S. with Babylon and On , `` Hourglass '' and `` 853-5937 '' . Difford left the group in 1999 launching a solo career in 2003 with his album I Did n't Get Where I Am .

          "context": "Pott 's fracture ( not to be confused with Pott 's disease ) , also known as Pott 's syndrome I and Dupuytren fracture , is an archaic term loosely applied to a variety of bimalleolar ankle fractures . The injury is caused by a combined abduction external rotation from an eversion force . This action strains the sturdy medial ( deltoid ) ligament of the ankle , often tearing off the medial malleolus due to its strong attachment . The talus then moves laterally , shearing off the lateral malleolus or , more commonly , breaking the fibula superior to the tibiofibular syndesmosis . If the tibia is carried anteriorly , the posterior margin of the distal end of the tibia is also sheared off by the talus . A fractured fibula in addition to detaching the medial malleolus will tear the tibiofibular syndesmosis . The combined fracture of the medial malleolus , lateral malleolus , and the posterior margin of the distal end of the tibia is known as a `` trimalleolar fracture . '' \n \n An example of Pott 's fracture would be in a sports tackling injury . The player receives a blow to the outside of the ankle , causing the ankle to roll inwards ( so that the sole of the foot faces laterally ) . This damages the ligaments on the inside of the ankle and fractures the fibula at the point of contact ( usually just above the tibiofibular syndesmosis ) . A better way to visualize this is the two hands of a clock , with one hand facing 12 and the other facing 6 . The vertical line they form represents the fibula of the person 's right leg . The lateral force approaches from 3 o'clock , sending the lower hand snapping outwards to point at 5 o'clock . \n \n Bimalleolar fractures are less likely to result in arthritis than trimalleolar fractures . \n \n History \n \n English physician Percivall Pott experienced this injury in 1765 and described his clinical findings in a paper published in 1769 . \n \n The term `` Dupuytren fracture '' refers to the same mechanism , and it is named for Guillaume Dupuytren .",

He lived in Kilburn , North Yorkshire , where he set up a business manufacturing oak furniture , which featured a carved mouse on almost every piece . It is claimed that the mouse motif came about accidentally in 1919 following a conversation about `` being as poor as a church mouse '' , which took place between Thompson and one of his colleagues during the carving of a cornice for a screen . This chance remark led to him carving a mouse and this remained part of his work from this point onwards . \n \n He was part of the 1920s revival of craftsmanship , inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement led by William Morris , John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle . More specific to furniture making in this genre and era include Stanley Webb Davies of Windermere . \n \n The workshop , now being run by his descendants , includes a showroom and visitors ' centre , and is located beside the Parish Church , which contains `` Mouseman '' pews , fittings and other furniture . The company is now known as `` Robert Thompson 's Craftsmen Ltd - The Mouseman of Kilburn .

          "context": "The Arbroath smokie is a type of smoked haddock – a speciality of the town of Arbroath in Angus , Scotland . \n \n History \n \n The Arbroath Smokie is said to have originated in the small fishing village of Auchmithie , three miles northeast of Arbroath . Local legend has it a store caught fire one night , destroying barrels of haddock preserved in salt . The following morning , the people found some of the barrels had caught fire , cooking the haddock inside . Inspection revealed the haddock to be quite tasty . It is much more likely the villagers were of Scandinavian descent , as the 'Smokie making ' process is similar to smoking methods which are still employed in areas of Scandinavia . \n \n Towards the end of the 19th century , as Arbroath 's fishing industry died , the Town Council offered the fisherfolk from Auchmithie land in an area of the town known as the fit o ' the toon . It also offered them use of the modern harbour . Much of the Auchmithie population then relocated , bringing the Arbroath Smokie recipe with them . Today , some 15 local businesses produce Arbroath smokies , selling them in major supermarkets in the UK and online . \n \n In 2004 , the European Commission registered the designation `` Arbroath smokies '' as a Protected Geographical Indication under the EU 's Protected Food Name Scheme , acknowledging its unique status . \n \n File : Arbroath Smokies - geograph.org.uk - 462399.jpg|Arbroath smokies at the Kirkcaldy Farmer 's Market \n File : Auchmithie Harbour - geograph.org.uk - 24546.jpg|Auchmithie Harbour . Auchmithie is the true home of the `` Arbroath '' smokie , \n File : Brothock Burn - geograph.org.uk - 725569.jpg|Brothock Burn , traditional home of the fishers . There are still smokehouses in back gardens to produce the Arbroath smokie . \n \n Preparation \n \n Arbroath smokies are prepared using traditional methods dating back to the late 1800s . \n \n The fish are first salted overnight . They are then tied in pairs using hemp twine , and left overnight to dry . Once they have been salted , tied and dried , they are hung over a triangular length of wood to smoke . This `` kiln stick '' fits between the two tied smokies , one fish on either side . The sticks are then used to hang the dried fish in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire . \n \n When the fish are hung over the fire , the top of the barrel is covered with a lid and sealed around the edges with wet jute sacks ( the water prevents the jute sacks from catching fire ) . All of this serves to create a very hot , humid and smoky fire . The intense heat and thick smoke is essential if the fish are to be cooked , not burned , and to have the strong , smoky taste and smell people expect from Arbroath smokies . Typically in less than an hour of smoking , the fish are ready to eat .",

It is the second novel in the first of three trilogies about Bernard Samson , a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the British Secret Intelligence Service ( MI6 ) . Mexico Set is part of the Game , Set and Match trilogy , being preceded by Berlin Game and followed by London Match . This trilogy is followed by the Hook , Line and Sinker trilogy and the final Faith , Hope and Charity trilogy . Deighton 's novel Winter ( 1987 ) is a prequel to the nine novels , covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters . \n \n Mexico Set continues the story that began with Berlin Game , where Bernard Samson 's wife Fiona was unmasked as a KGB double agent . \n \n Plot summary \n \n The story begins in Mexico , where Samson is on the trail of his Soviet opposite number : Erich Stinnes , a KGB major working in East Germany whom London Central wishes to coax over to the West . \n \n The task of laying the delicate and elaborate groundwork for Stinnes ' defection propels Samson from Mexico to London , Paris , Berlin , and the East-West border . What happens along the way—-a temporary abduction , an unnecessary murder , an inconvenient suicide—-happens so fast that Samson hardly seems able to keep London Central informed of developments . Or is it that Samson wants to keep his colleagues in the dark ? Certainly London Central 's entire senior staff—from Samson 's immediate supervisors , locked in their endless internecine office warfare , to the dotty Director-General himself—would have reason to suspect that Samson might be working for the other side . He was , after all , closer than any of the other to the former traitor-in-their-midst . \n \n And Samson himself is losing control—indeed , events seem to be controlling him . As he finds himself in a series of ever more incriminating positions , as one by one the avenues of escape or vindication close before him , the novel winds back toward Mexico .. and toward the astonishing climax - at the scene of the defection Samson has so painstakingly orchestrated—in which the allegiances of all involved are finally and fatefully revealed . \n \n Years after its publication , Granada TV made a version of the trilogy for ITV , called Game , Set and Match , starring Ian Holm as Bernard Samson and Mel Martin as Fiona . It was adapted by John Howlett and directed by Ken Grieve and Patrick Lau .",

It is the concluding novel in the first of three trilogies about Bernard Samson , a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the British Secret Intelligence Service ( MI6 ) . London Match is part of the Game , Set and Match trilogy , being preceded by Berlin Game and Mexico Set . This trilogy is followed by the Hook , Line and Sinker trilogy and the final Faith , Hope and Charity trilogy . Deighton 's novel Winter ( 1987 ) is a prequel to the nine novels , covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters . \n \n London Match concludes the story that began with Berlin Game , where Bernard Samson 's wife Fiona was unmasked as a KGB double agent and was forced into defecting , and that was continued in Mexico Set , where Bernard Samson assisted the defection of Erich Stinnes , his KGB opposite number . \n \n Plot summary \n \n Samson suspects that there is a traitor within his department of MI6 , due to the appearance of a memorandum which was leaked to the KGB . It transpires that it is part of a plot conducted by his wife - now working for East German intelligence - to frame his superior , Bret Rensselaer , as a KGB agent . When Samson 's old friend Werner Volkmann is arrested by the East German police Samson organizes an unauthorised exchange of defector Erich Stinnes for him , but the operation ends in a shootout on the Berlin S-Bahn . \n \n Adaptations \n \n Bernard Samson was played by Ian Holm and Fiona Samson by Mel Martin in a 1988 Granada Television adaptation of the first trilogy , entitled Game , Set and Match , transmitted as twelve 60 minute episodes . Filmed on location in Berlin and Mexico , the project included a large international cast with 3,000 extras and a budget of $ 8 million . While critically acclaimed , the ratings for the series were a disaster . It was adapted by John Howlett and directed by Ken Grieve and Patrick Lau . \n \n Notes",

The climate is Sahelian , but there is a rainy season . \n \n Cultures and influences \n \n The territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since the Prehistory . Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century , and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the Jolof Empire . The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism , which began during the mid-15th century , when various European powers began competing for trade in the area . The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland , culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century , albeit amid much local resistance . Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960 , and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa . \n \n Senegal 's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources . Major industries are fish processing , phosphate mining , fertilizer production , petroleum refining , construction materials , ship construction and repair . As in most African nations , agriculture is a major sector , with Senegal producing several important cash crops , including peanuts , sugarcane , cotton , green beans , tomatoes , melons , and mangoes.Ndiaye , Mbalo .

While not comedies , George A. Romero 's Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) and Day of the Dead ( 1985 ) featured several comedic scenes . An American Werewolf in London ( 1981 ) and the Return of the Living Dead series ( 1985 ) ( especially the first two and the last of the series ) can be considered some of the earliest examples of Zombie-comedy using the modern zombie . Other early examples include Mr. Vampire , CHUD II : Bud the CHUD ( 1989 ) , Braindead ( 1992 ) , and Bio Zombie ( 1998 ) . \n \n Modern zombie comedies include Edgar Wright 's Shaun of the Dead ( which was in fact a self-dubbed Romantic Zombie Comedy , or RomZomCom ) . This movie made many in-jokes and references to George A. Romero 's earlier Dead films , especially \n Dawn of the Dead . \n \n Andrew Currie 's Fido , Matthew Leutwyler 's Dead & Breakfast , and Peter Jackson 's Braindead , are also good examples of zombie comedies . Sam Raimi 's Evil Dead II , although a more direct horror film , contains some light hearted and dark comedy elements , and its sequel , Army of Darkness , is even more comedic . The Evil Dead series does not , however , feature any traditional style zombies . \n \n Other films that could be considered zombie comedies include the 1986 film Redneck Zombies , 1993 's My Boyfriend 's Back , 1986 's Night of the Creeps , 1998 's Bio Zombie , 1999 's Idle Hands , starring Devon Sawa and Seth Green , 2005 's Tokyo Zombie , 2005 's Poultrygeist : Night of the Chicken Dead , 2008 's Dance of the Dead and Zombie Strippers , as well as 2009 's Dead Snow and Zombieland , starring Woody Harrelson , Jesse Eisenberg , Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin , Zombie Dearest , 2011 's DeadHeads , 2013 's Warm Bodies , Buck Wild Movie , Zombie eXs , First Platoon and Cockneys vs Zombies , 2014 's Life After Beth . and Dead Snow 2 : Red vs. Dead , and 2015 's Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse . \n \n Bollywood ( Hindi ) movie `` Go Goa Gone '' is also such movie . Another example of the genre is `` Juan De Los Muertos '' ( 2010 ) , released in the UK and US as `` Juan of The Dead '' .",

Given the ongoing ( as of July 2016 ) Yemeni Civil War it seems unlikely that the project will start in the near future . \n \n Prospective structure \n \n The length of the bridge is estimated at 29 km , with a total cost of around $ 20 billion USD . It has been proposed by the Dubai-based firm Middle East Development LLC headed by Tarek Bin Laden . Opening date is expected to be in the year 2020 . \n \n To clear submarine and surface vessels , the proposed bridge would have the longest suspension span in the world measuring 5 km . The overall length of the entire bridge spanning the Red Sea , starting in Yemen , connecting to the island of Perim , and continuing on to Djibouti on the African continent , would be roughly . It would have to allow very large ships of the Suezmax size in both directions simultaneously . \n \n It was claimed that about 100,000 cars and 50,000 rail passengers would cross the bridge daily . \n \n Expected use \n \n Twin cities , referred to as Al Noor City , would be built on either end of the bridge ; the prospective site 's developers indicate that they will run on renewable energy . On the Djibouti side , President Ismael Omar Guelleh granted 500 km2 to build Noor City , the first of the hundreds of Cities of Light which the Saudi Binladen Group envisions building . The developers state that they expect Noor City to have 2.5 million residents by 2025 , and the Yemeni twin city to have 4.5 million , while they envision a new airport serving both cities at a capacity of 100 million passengers annually . A new highway connecting the cities to Dubai is proposed , though there are no plans for roads to connect sparsely populated Djibouti with the population centers of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia or Khartoum in Sudan . One of the uses that are imagined for this bridge is for easy transcontinental access to the Hajj in Mecca . \n \n The Economist magazine , noting that developers state that the project will make Noor City the `` financial , educational , and medical hub of Africa '' , commented , `` Africans may wonder why the hub is not being built in a bit of Africa where more Africans live and which has food and water .

While it is stated that they were twin brothers , that has not been positively proved . [ http : //www.newadvent.org/cathen/04491a.htm Meier , Gabriel . `` Sts . Crispin and Crispinian . '' The Catholic Encyclopedia . Vol . 4 . New York : Robert Appleton Company , 1908 . 14 Mar . 2015 ] \n \n They earned enough by their trade to support themselves and also to aid the poor . Their success attracted the ire of Rictus Varus , governor of Belgic Gaul , who had them tortured and thrown into the river with millstones around their necks . Though they survived , they were beheaded by the Emperor c. 286 . \n \n An alternative account gives them to be sons of a noble Romano-Briton family who lived in Canterbury , following their father 's murder for displeasing the Roman Emperor . As they were approaching maturity their mother sent them to London to seek apprenticeship and to avoid coming to the attention of their father 's killer . Travelling there , the brothers came across a shoemaker 's workshop at Faversham and decided to travel no further and stayed in Faversham . This account fails to explain how the brothers came to be venerated and martyred . \n \n Veneration \n \n The feast day of Saints Crispin and Crispinian is 25 October . Although this feast was removed from the Roman Catholic Church 's universal liturgical calendar following the Second Vatican Council , the two saints are still commemorated on that day in the most recent edition of the Roman Church 's martyrology . \n \n In the sixth century a stately basilica was erected at Soissons over the graves of these saints , and St. Eligius , a famous goldsmith , made a costly shrine for the head of St. Crispinian . \n \n Popular culture \n \n Saint Crispin is often associated with the Battle of Agincourt since the battle was fought on his feastday . It has been immortalised by Shakespeare 's St. Crispin 's Day Speech from his play Henry V. Also , for the Midsummer 's Day Festival in the third act of Die Meistersinger , Wagner has the shoemakers ' guild enter singing a song of praise to St. Crispin . \n \n A plaque at Faversham commemorates their association with the town . They are also commemorated in the name of the old pub `` Crispin and Crispianus '' at Strood .",

Twain , a former printer , invested not only the bulk of his book profits but also a large portion of the inheritance of Olivia Clemens , his wife . Many point to his over-investment in the Paige typesetting machine and other inventions as the cause of not only his family 's financial decline but also the decline of his wit and humor . \n \n Only two machines were built .

His experiments brought forth two generalizations which later became known as Mendel 's Laws of Inheritance . \n \n The Abbey is unique amongst modern Augustinian foundations because it is not called a priory , and indeed it has an abbot ( Prälat - prelate ) whereas all other existing Augustinian friaries are led by a prior . \n \n History \n \n The Augustinians arrived in Brno in 1346 , and John Henry of Luxemburg ( Jan Jindřich Lucemburský ) , Margrave of Moravia , began the construction of their original cloister in 1352 . These premises are located on Moravian Square . In 1650s , a musical foundation for the monastery was established , with paid musical scholars . This was the early beginning of a long and significant musical tradition at the Brno monastery . In 1780s , the Emperor Joseph II forced the friars to move out because he liked their well-located and representative buildings . These were given to the governor office and the church was turned to standard parish church . The friars moved to suburban Staré Brno where they took over the abolished Cistercian convent and church . \n \n Czech composer Pavel Křížkovský also took monastic vows at Brno , teaching liturgical music from 1848 until 1872 , and from 1865 he formed an ongoing musical collaboration with the young ( lay ) composer Leoš Janáček who had come from his home in Hukvaldy and begun as a choirboy at the monastery . \n \n Burials at the abbey \n \n Mendel Museum \n \n The Augustinian Abbey now hosts the Mendel Museum of Genetics dedicated to the founder of genetics .

Elizabeth II had ascended to the throne just over five years before the Act . The Conservatives tried to introduce life peerages to modernise the House of Lords , give it more legitimacy , and respond to a decline in its numbers and attendance . The Labour Party opposed the Life Peerages Bill on Second Reading : Hugh Gaitskell made an impassioned speech against the proposals , arguing for a far more fundamental reform such as total dismantling of the Lords or a wholly elected house . \n \n Summary \n \n Prior to the Life Peerages Act 1958 , membership in the House of Lords was strictly male and overwhelmingly based on possession of an hereditary title . There existed a few exceptions to the hereditary principle , such as for the Lords Spiritual . The Act made it possible for life peers of both sexes to be members of the Lords . Life peers are either barons ( a title deprecated for British nobles which has been replaced with Lord for all but the most formal documents since the early medieval period ) or baronesses ( where female ) and are members of the House of Lords for life , but their titles and membership in `` the Lords '' are not inherited by their children . Judicial life peers already sat in the House under the terms of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 . The Life Peerages Act vastly increased the ability of the Prime Minister to change the composition of the House of Lords by permitting the creation of groups of life peers rather than the more difficult to justify hereditary peerages . This gradually began to diminish the numerical dominance of hereditary peers . \n \n The Act allowed for the creation of female peers entitled to sit in the House of Lords . The first such women peers took their seats on 21 October 1958 . \n \n A life peer is created by the sovereign by Letters Patent under the Great Seal on the advice of the Prime Minister . \n \n Before the Act was passed , former Prime Ministers were usually created Viscounts or Earls ( which are hereditary peerages ) in gratitude for their public service in high office . This similarly applied to the Viceroys of India and exceptional military or front bench figures , for example the former Secretary of State for India and earlier for Air , Viscount Stansgate . The last Prime Minister and the last non-royal to be made an Earl was paradoxically one of the Act 's proponents , Harold Macmillan , on Thatcher 's advice , in the 1980s . In modern practice , only members of the Royal Family are granted new hereditary peerages . \n \n Historic approval and 1999 adjustment of House composition \n \n In 1999 , during the debate which secured the removal of the constitutional functions of most hereditary peers , the Minister for Constitutional Affairs , Geoff Hoon stated : \n \n After this agreed with a question from fellow Labour MP , Mark Fisher which stated :",

His understudy stepped in , until Fry was replaced by Simon Ward . Nevertheless , the production closed on 25 March 1995 . \n \n Later in 1995 , Gray released an autobiographical account of the production , called Fat Chance .

Bourke helps Blake escape to Moscow , after which Blake did not want to let Bourke leave Moscow to return to his native Ireland . \n \n Controversy \n \n In 1995 , Stephen Fry famously walked out of the play near the start of its West End run , after his performance received a bad review in the Financial Times . It was reported at the time that he suffered an attack of stage fright , but he has since disclosed that it was bipolar disorder . Fry walked out of the production for good , leaving only an apology , and provoking its early closure . \n \n Simon Gray described Fry 's action as `` cowardly '' , and in a statement to the press said : `` It is disgraceful that so much media attention has been devoted to this squalid little story . . . I confess my own failure as a director was to have cast Stephen Fry in the first place , and in the second place , not to have acknowledged my error by requesting his departure after his ( self-proclaimed ) inadequacies were abundantly clear to me . '' In response to the suggestion his reaction was insensitive to Fry 's predicament , Gray added : `` I 'm a friend of Stephen 's . I have great sympathy because he was hurt and stressed , but what he left behind him was the most awful chaos and distress for other people who loved him , including me . '' \n \n Fry disappeared from the public eye , travelling to Belgium , and contemplating suicide . Referring to himself in the third person , he says that `` the experience still haunts him , but the depression has now faded to embarrassment and the anger to forgiveness . ''",

Still , molecular evidence suggests the genus is not monophyletic . Several other genera in the subfamily Vespertilioninae have also been merged with Pipistrellus in previous classifications . Species in the genus may be referred to as `` pipistrelles '' or `` pipistrelle bats '' , though these terms are also used for species now placed in other genera , such as the western pipistrelle ( Parastrellus hesperus ) and eastern pipistrelle ( Perimyotis subflavus ) of North America . \n \n They are somewhat distinguished from their much larger relativess , the noctule bats Nyctalus by their weak , fluttery flight reminiscent of a butterfly , though a few species are more direct in their flight . \n \n Species \n \n * Japanese pipistrelle , P. abramus \n * Forest pipistrelle or Adams 's pipistrelle , P. adamsi \n * Mount Gargues pipistrelle , P. aero \n * Angulate pipistrelle , P. angulatus \n * Kelaart 's pipistrelle , P. ceylonicus \n * Greater Papuan pipistrelle , P. collinus \n * Indian pipistrelle , P. coromandra \n * Egyptian pipistrelle , P. deserti \n * Endo 's pipistrelle , P. endoi \n * Grandidier 's pipistrelle , P. grandidieri \n * Hanaki 's dwarf bat , P. hanaki \n * Dusky pipistrelle , P. hesperidus \n * Aellen 's pipistrelle , P. inexspectatus \n * Java pipistrelle , P. javanicus \n * Kuhl 's pipistrelle , P. kuhlii \n * Madeira pipistrelle , P. maderensis \n * Minahassa pipistrelle , P. minahassae \n * Christmas Island pipistrelle , P. murrayi ( † ? , last sighted in August 2009 ) \n * Tiny pipistrelle , P. nanulus \n * Nathusius 's pipistrelle , P. nathusii \n * Lesser Papuan pipistrelle , P. papuanus \n * Mount Popa pipistrelle , P. paterculus \n * Dar es Salaam pipistrelle , P. permixtus \n * Common pipistrelle , P. pipistrellus \n * Soprano pipistrelle , P. pygmaeus \n * Racey 's pipistrelle , P. raceyi \n * Rüppell 's pipistrelle , P. rueppellii \n * Rusty pipistrelle , P. rusticus \n * Narrow-winged pipistrelle , P. stenopterus \n * Sturdee 's pipistrelle , P. sturdeei ( † 2000 ) \n * Least pipistrelle , P. tenuis \n * Watts 's pipistrelle , P. wattsi \n * Northern pipistrelle or Koopman 's pipistrelle , P. westralis \n * Vordermann 's pipistrelle , ' P . vordermanni",

This order , first described by J. Illiger in 1811 , encompasses the trunked mammals . Later proboscideans are distinguished by tusks and long , muscular trunks ; these features are less developed or absent in early proboscideans . Proboscidea may have produced the largest land mammal of all time in the form of Palaeoloxodon namadicus , which may have weighed up to 22 MT , with a shoulder height of up to 5 m , surpassing several sauropod dinosaurs . \n \n The earliest known proboscidean is Eritherium , followed by Phosphatherium , a small animal about the size of a fox . These both date from late Paleocene deposits of Morocco . \n \n Proboscideans diversified during the Eocene and early Oligocene . Several primitive families from these epochs have been described , including Numidotheriidae , Moeritheriidae , and Barytheriidae in Africa . ( Anthracobunidae from the Indian subcontinent has also been included , but was excluded from Proboscidea by Shoshani & Tassy ( 2005 ) and has more recently been assigned to Perissodactyla . ) These were followed by the earliest Deinotheriidae , or `` hoe tuskers '' , which thrived during the Miocene and into the early Quaternary . Proboscideans from the Miocene also included Stegolophodon , an early genus of the disputed family Stegodontidae ; the diverse family of Gomphotheriidae , or `` shovel tuskers '' , such as Platybelodon and Amebelodon ; and the Mammutidae , or mastodons . \n \n Most families of Proboscidea are now extinct , many since the end of the last glacial period . Recently extinct species include the last examples of gomphotheres in Central and South America , the American mastodon of family Mammutidae in North America , numerous stegodonts once found in Asia , the last of the mammoths , and several island species of dwarf elephants . \n \n Classification \n \n Proboscidea \n : incertae sedis †Moeritheriidae \n : :†Moeritherium \n : †Plesielephantiformes \n : :†Numidotheriidae \n : :†Barytheriidae \n : :†Deinotheriidae \n : Elephantiformes \n : :†Palaeomastodontidae \n : :†Phiomiidae \n : :Elephantimorpha \n : : : incertae sedis †Eritreum \n : : : †Hemimastodontidae \n : : : †Mammutida ( mastodons ) \n : : : :†Mammutoidea \n : : : : : †Mammutidae \n : : : Elephantida \n : : : :†Amebelodontidae \n : : : :†Choerolophodontidae \n : : : :†Gomphotheriidae ( gomphotheres ) \n : : : :Elephantoidea \n : : : : : incertae sedis †Tetralophodon \n : : : : : incertae sedis †Morrillia \n : : : : : incertae sedis †Anancus \n : : : : : incertae sedis †Paratetralophodon \n : : : : : †Stegodontidae \n : : : : : Elephantidae \n : : : : : :†Stegotetrabelodontinae \n : : : : : : : †Stegotetrabelodon \n : : : : : : : †Stegodibelodon \n : : : : : :Elephantinae ( elephants and mammoths ) \n : : : : : : : †Primelephas \n : : : : : : : Loxodontini \n : : : : : : : :Loxodonta \n : : : : : : : Elephantini \n : : : : : : : :†Palaeoloxodon \n : : : : : : : :Elephas \n : : : : : : : :†Mammuthus",

The U.S. National Weather Service defines a gale as 34–47 knots ( , or ) of sustained surface winds . Forecasters typically issue gale warnings when winds of this strength are expected . \n \n Other sources use minima as low as 28 knots ( 28 kn , 28 kn ) and maxima as high as 90 knots ( 90 kn , 90 kn ) . Through 1986 , the National Hurricane Center used the term gale to refer to winds of tropical force for coastal areas , between 33 knots ( 33 kn , 33 kn ) and 63 knots ( 63 kn , 63 kn ) . The 90 kn definition is very non-standard . A common alternative definition of the maximum is 55 knots ( 55 kn , 55 kn ) . \n \n The most common way of measuring winds is with the Beaufort scale , which defines a gale as wind from 50 to 102 km/h . It is an empirical measure for describing wind speed based mainly on observed sea conditions . Its full name is the Beaufort Wind Force Scale . \n \n On the Beaufort Wind Scale , a gale is classified as : 7 : Moderate Gale ( 32–38 miles per hour ) , 8 : Fresh Gale ( 39-46 mph ) , 9 : Strong Gale ( 47-54 mph ) and 10 : Storm/Whole Gale ( 55-63 mph ) . A gale is a type of Wind Description preceded by 0 : Calm , 1 : Light Air , 2 : Light Breeze , 3 : Gentle Breeze , 4 : Moderate Breeze , 5 : Fresh Breeze , 6 : Strong Breeze and succeeded by 11 : Violent Storm and 12 : Hurricane on a Beaufort Wind Scale . There is a unique Beaufort Scale number and a unique Arrow Indication for each type of Wind Description mentioned above . \n \n The word gale is derived from the older gail , but its origin is uncertain .",

Of these , 15,209 ( 69.5 % ) lived in urban areas and 6,665 ( 30.5 % ) in rural areas . The population grew by 31.9 % ( 5,284 persons ) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses . \n \n Administration \n \n As a commune , Casablanca is a third-level administrative division of Chile , administered by a municipal council , which is headed by a directly elected alcalde .

It is a Denomination of Origin ( DO ) defined by the Chilean Appellation system , the legally defined and protected geographical indication used to identify where the grapes for a wine were grown . The valley takes its name from the commune of Casablanca and stretches roughly 30 km ( 19 miles ) east-west from eastern border of the Valparaíso province in the Valparaíso region . \n Vines were first planted here in the mid-1980s during the revitalization of the Chilean wine industry and quickly became known for its white wines , most notably Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay , as well as Pinot Noir , which thrives in its cooler climate . \n Although the valley is located at 33°S , much closer to the Equator than any European vineyard , viticulture here is possible because of the cooling influence of the Pacific ocean , in the shape of cool morning fog and greater cloud cover than is found elsewhere in the north of Chile . \n \n Grape distribution by varietal \n \n * Climate : Cool Mediterranean climate with pronounced maritime influence . 540 mm ( 21.2 in ) of rain per year . \n * Soils : clay and sandy soils . \n * Primary grapes : Chardonnay , Pinot Noir , Sauvignon Blanc . \n \n \n \n * Total hectares planted : 1,429 ha ( 3531 acres ) .",

          "context": "Woolton pie , at first known as Lord Woolton pie , was an adaptable inexpensive dish of vegetables , widely served in Britain in the Second World War when rationing and shortages made other dishes hard to prepare . It was created at the Savoy Hotel in London by its then Maitre Chef de Cuisine , Francis Latry . It was one of a number of recipes commended to the British public by the Ministry of Food during the Second World War to enable a nutritious diet to be maintained despite shortages and rationing of many types of food , especially meat . It was named after Frederick Marquis , 1st Lord Woolton ( 1883–1964 ) , who popularized the recipe after he became Minister of Food in 1940 . \n \n Recipe \n \n The recipe involved dicing and cooking potatoes ( or parsnips ) , cauliflower , swede , carrots and , possibly , turnip . Rolled oats and chopped spring onions were added to the thickened vegetable water which was poured over the vegetables themselves . The dish was topped with potato pastry and grated cheese and served with vegetable gravy . The recipe could be adapted to reflect the availability and seasonality of ingredients . \n \n Reception \n \n People realised that meat was in very scarce supply , but that still did not overcome traditions of meat pies . Woolton pie , entirely lacking meat , was not universally well received . An editorial in The Times commented : \n \n Professor John Fuller has noted that Woolton pie and similar wartime austerity dishes `` were forgotten as quickly as possible when conditions returned to normal '' . ( One notable exception to this pattern is carrot cake which , while not invented during the war , was popularised in the United Kingdom during that period because it used the widely available root vegetable in place of some of the scarce flour , fat and sugar found in other cakes . ) \n \n Publication \n \n The recipe for Woolton pie has been published on a number of occasions since the war , notably in collections to mark significant anniversaries , e.g . Marguerite Patten 's ( 1985 ) We 'll Eat Again , marking the 40th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe .",

He was shot and killed by Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar public house in Whitechapel , east London . Kray was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder three years later and remained in Broadmoor Hospital until his death in 1995 . \n \n History \n \n Cornell hailed from east London and was originally known as George Myers but had changed his surname some years earlier . Cornell was a tough , loyal enforcer who worked for the Richardson Gang ; he was known for being totally fearless . A childhood friend of the Kray twins , Cornell was a prominent criminal in east London during the 1960s and upon moving to South London joined up with the Kray twins ' rivals , the Richardson Gang , who were brothers Charlie Richardson and Eddie Richardson . \n \n Cornell , along with Richardson gang colleague and friend `` Mad '' Frankie Fraser , became an enforcer for the Richardsons and was primarily used by them for talks with the Krays . Meetings were often held in pubs such as The Grave Maurice . \n \n Death \n \n On 9 March 1966 , Cornell and his friend Albie Woods entered the Blind Beggar pub , ordered some light ales and then sat upon stools next to the bar . At around 8:30pm , both men were approached by Ronnie Kray ; on seeing him , Cornell sneered with sarcasm `` Look who 's here '' . Ronnie Kray walked towards Cornell , took out a 9 mm Luger , and calmly shot him once in the forehead , just above his right eye . \n \n Cornell slumped against a nearby pillar , the bullet , apparently , passing straight through him . He was taken to a nearby hospital , where he died at around 03:30am . \n \n The news spread rapidly . Although Ronnie Kray was identified by several eyewitnesses as he calmly left the public house , no one would agree to testify against him and the police were forced to release him from custody . Cornell was buried in Camberwell New Cemetery , south London . \n \n Old Bailey trial \n \n On 4 March 1969 Ronnie Kray was unanimously found guilty by a jury at The Old Bailey of the murder of George Cornell . His brother Reggie was also found guilty of murdering Jack McVitie , who was killed the year after Cornell . They were both sentenced to life imprisonment . \n \n Ronnie Kray died in jail in March 1995 , while Reggie Kray was imprisoned for a total of 32 years before he was released from custody on compassionate grounds in August 2000 as a result of cancer , from which he died a few weeks after his release .",

The city also gives its name to the nearby Arrecife Airport . \n \n The population of the municipality is 55,673 ( 2013 ) , its area is 22.72 km² .

The LZ1 road connects Arrecife with to the north , the LZ2 road with the southwest , and the LZ3 road serves as the beltway of the city . The tallest building in Lanzarote is the Gran Hotel Arrecife , which is located on the front alongside the harbour . \n \n History \n \n The earliest records of Arrecife date from the fifteenth century when it was a small fishing settlement . The name , given then as Arrecifes , refers to the black volcanic reefs behind which boats could hide , protected from sudden pirate attacks . \n \n Towards the end of the sixteenth century the settlement began to grow in response to a need for accommodation and warehousing to support growing trade between the old and new worlds . The first church was constructed at this time , consecrated to the first bishop of Arrecife , San Ginés . Growing prosperity increased the attractiveness of the town as a pirate target : in 1571 a notorious pirate named Dogan plundered and almost completely destroyed the little port town . \n \n In 1964 Arrecife became the site of Lanzarote 's first sea-water desalination plant , which was still operational in 2010 . \n \n Climate \n \n Lanzarote has a desert climate according to the Köppen climatic classification .

He retired from aeronautical design in 1944 , forming the company Andrews Maclaren and making aircraft components . \n \n Collapsible baby buggy \n \n The former test pilot and designer of the Supermarine Spitfire undercarriage was inspired when his daughter visited from the United States with his first grandchild . After watching the parents struggle with the clumsy conventional pushchair , he used his knowledge of lightweight , collapsible structures to create a new generation of infant transport and inspire the design of future collapsible objects such as the Strida bicycle . \n \n He designed his first buggy in 1965 , which was built in his medieval farmhouse stables in Barby , Northamptonshire in England just south of Rugby . He applied for a patent , on 20 July 1965 , for his 6lb B01 prototype with lightweight aluminium tubes receiving Patent No . 1,154,362 . On 18 July 1966 he filed for an American patent , receiving Patent No . 3,390,893 . \n \n Only after this design would aluminium tubes be used in other household equipment . The buggy went on sale in 1967 . He also designed the 'Gadabout folding chair ' which was produced from 1961 , and was commissioned by the Ministry of Health to design a larger folding buggy for larger children with disabilities called the 'Buggy Major ' this buggy was designed on square tubes instead of the usual round tubes like the 'Baby Buggy ' , being produced around 1970 . \n \n Today the modern version of the 'Baby Buggy ' are sold in over 50 countries under the Maclaren brand based in Long Buckby . \n \n Personal life \n \n He was married to Marie and they had a son and daughter . \n \n In January 1978 Queen Elizabeth II awarded him with an MBE in the New Year 's Honours List . \n \n Notes",

W. Bush . \n \n Carville 's original phrase was meant for the internal audience of Clinton 's campaign workers as one of the three messages to focus on , the other two messages being `` Change vs. more of the same '' and `` Do n't forget health care . '' \n \n Clinton 's campaign had advantageously used the then-prevailing recession situation in the US as one of the campaign 's means to successfully unseat George H. W. Bush . In March 1991 , days after the ground invasion of Iraq , 90 % of polled Americans approved of President Bush 's job performance.Agiesta , Jennifer . [ http : //blog.washingtonpost.com/behind-the-numbers/2007/07/approval_highs_and_lows.html Approval Highs and Lows ] . The Washington Post . 2007-07-24 . Later the next year , Americans ' opinions had turned sharply ; 64 % of polled Americans disapproved of Bush 's job performance in August 1992 . \n \n History \n \n In order to keep the campaign on message , Carville hung a sign in Bill Clinton 's Little Rock campaign headquarters that read : \n \n # Change vs. more of the same \n # The economy , stupid \n # Do n't forget health care . \n \n Although the sign was intended for an internal audience of campaign workers , the phrase became a de facto slogan for the Clinton election campaign . \n \n Legacy \n \n The phrase has become a snowclone repeated often in American political culture , usually starting with the word `` it 's '' and with commentators sometimes using a different word in place of `` economy . '' Examples include `` It 's the deficit , stupid ! '' `` It 's the corporation , stupid ! '' `` It 's the math , stupid ! '' and `` It 's the voters , stupid ! `` . In British political satire The Thick of It , `` It 's the Everything , Stupid '' was the name of a book written by one of the characters . In a later episode a character shouts `` it 's the economy , Stewpot '' at spin doctor Stewart Pearson . \n In an episode of the TV series The West Wing , `` the economy stupid '' can be seen written on a whiteboard in Bartlet 's campaign headquarters . \n In an episode of Weeds , `` it 's the economy , stupid '' is a line said by a crazy man rambling about his free goat . \n Composer-lyricist Stephen Schwartz and bookwriter Winnie Holzman created their own version of the phrase while working on the hit musical Wicked : `` It 's the girls , stupid '' to keep their plot focused on the musical 's two female leads , Elphaba and Glinda . \n Another variant of the phrase , `` It 's the constitution , stupid '' or `` It 's about the constitution , stupid '' , has been used by several parties in various election campaigns . It has appeared on bumper stickers against the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2004 , for the Ron Paul ticket in 2008 , and has appeared in video ads for the Gary Johnson ticket in 2012 .",

          "context": "The stigma ( plural : stigmata ) is the receptive tip of a carpel , or of several fused carpels , in the gynoecium of a flower . \n \n Description \n \n The stigma , together with the style and ovary comprises the pistil , which in turn is part of the gynoecium or female reproductive organ of a plant . The stigma receives pollen and it is on the stigma that the pollen grain germinates . Often sticky , the stigma is adapted in various ways to catch and trap pollen with various hairs , flaps , or sculpturings . The pollen may be captured from the air ( wind-borne pollen , anemophily ) , from visiting insects or other animals ( biotic pollination ) , or in rare cases from surrounding water ( hydrophily ) . Stigmata can vary from long and slender to globe shaped to feathery . \n \n Pollen is typically highly desiccated when it leaves an anther . Stigmata have been shown to assist in the rehydration of pollen and in promoting germination of the pollen tube . Stigmata also ensure proper adhesion of the correct species of pollen . Stigmata can play an active role in pollen discrimination and some self-incompatibility reactions , that reject pollen from the same or genetically similar plants , involve interaction between the stigma and the surface of the pollen grain . \n \n Shape \n \n The stigma is often split into lobes , e.g . trifid ( three lobed ) , or may resemble the head of a pin ( capitate ) . \n \n Shapes may vary considerably : \n \n Style \n \n The style connects the stigma to the ovary . It may be absent in some plants in the case the stigma is called as sessile . Styles are generally tube-like — either long or short . The style can be open ( containing few or no cells in the central portion ) or closed ( densely packed with cells throughout ) . Pollen tubes grow the length of the style to reach the ovules , and in some cases self-incompatibility reactions in the style prevent full growth of the pollen tubes . Studies have shown that in some species , including Gasteria at least , the pollen tube is directed to the micropyle of the ovule by the style.Christophe Clement , Ettore Pacini , Jean-Claude Audran ( Editors ) \n \n In Irises and others in the Iridaceae family , the style divides into three petal-like ( petaloid ) , style branches ( or stylodia ) , which are flaps of tissue , running from the perianth tube above the sepal . The stigma is a rim or edge on the underside of the branch , near the end lobes . Style branches also appear on Dietes , Pardanthopsis and most species of Moraea.Klaus Kubitzki ( Editor ) \n \n In Crocuses , there are three divided style branches , creating a tube . Hesperantha has a spreading style branch . Gladiolus has a bi-lobed style branch . Freesia , Lapeirousia , Romulea , Savannosiphon and Watsonia have bifuracated ( two branched ) and recurved style branches . \n \n Attachment to the ovary \n \n May be terminal , lateral , or gynobasic",

It is run at York over a distance of 1 mile and 6 furlongs ( 2,816 metres ) , and it is scheduled to take place each year in August . \n \n History \n \n The event is named after the shortened form of Eboracum , the Roman name for York . It was first run in 1843 , and it was originally known as the Great Ebor Handicap . The race was introduced by John Orton , a newly appointed Clerk of the Course at York . It was initially contested over 2 miles , but its distance was later cut by 2 furlongs . \n \n The planned running of the Ebor Handicap in 2008 was abandoned because of a waterlogged track . It was replaced by an event at Newbury called the Newburgh Handicap , a reference to the town 's original Norman name . \n \n The race is now held on the final day of York 's four-day Ebor Festival meeting .

The saint wears the blue garter of the English Order of the Garter , reflecting the award of this decoration in 1504 to Raphael 's patron Guidobaldo da Montefeltro , Duke of Urbino , by King Henry VII of England . The first word of the order 's motto , `` HONI '' can be made out . The painting was presumably commissioned by the Duke , either to present to the English emissary who brought the regalia to Urbino , Sir Gilbert Talbot , or to Henry himself—recent scholarship suggests the latter . The honour paid to a minor Italian ruler reflected Henry 's appreciation of the cultural prestige of Renaissance Italy as much as any diplomatic purpose . \n \n The traditional subject , Saint George and the Dragon , combining chivalry and Christianity , is appropriate for the occasion ; like his father , Guidobaldo was a condottiero , or proprietor of a band of mercenary soldiers . In the early stages of his career Raphael painted a number of tiny cabinet paintings , including another St George in the Louvre , and the Vision of a Knight in the National Gallery in London . \n \n Provenance \n \n By 1627 the painting belonged to William Herbert , 3rd Earl of Pembroke ( 1580-1630 ) , and was at Wilton House in Wiltshire . Either the 3rd or 4th earl presented it to King Charles I of England . After the English Civil War it was sold in one of the sales of the Royal Collection at Somerset House in London on 19 December 1651 . Soon after it was in France . The painting was later a highlight of the Pierre Crozat collection which was acquired through Diderot 's mediation by Catherine II of Russia in 1772 . For a century and a half , the panel hung in the Imperial Hermitage Museum . It was one of the most popular paintings in the entire collection of the Tsars . In March 1931 it was part of the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings , and bought by Andrew Mellon , as part of his founding donation to the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C . This and other foundational artworks , including paintings by Jan van Eyck , Sandro Botticelli , and Titian , helped place the National Gallery among the most significant collections of Renaissance art .",

Although Serket does not appear to have had any temples , she had a sizable number of priests in many communities . \n \n The most dangerous species of scorpion resides in North Africa , and its sting may kill , so Serket was considered a highly important goddess , and was sometimes considered by pharaohs to be their patron . Her close association with the early kings implies that she was their protector , two being referred to as the scorpion kings . \n \n As the protector against venoms and snake bites , Serket often was said to protect the deities from Apep , the great snake-demon of evil , sometimes being depicted as the guard when Apep was captured . \n \n As many of the venomous creatures of Egypt could prove fatal , Serket also was considered a protector of the dead , particularly being associated with venoms and fluids causing stiffening . She was thus said to be the protector of the tents of embalmers , and of the canopic jar associated with venom—the jar of the intestine—which was deified later as Qebehsenuf , one of the Four sons of Horus , who were her sons by one of the two Horuses ( Horus the Younger or Horus the Elder ) . \n \n As the guard of one of the canopic jars and a protector , Serket gained a strong association with Aset ( Isis ) , Nebet Het ( Nephthys ) , and Neith who also performed similar functions . Eventually , later in Egyptian history that spanned thousands of years and whose pantheon evolved toward a merger of many deities , Serket began to be identified with Isis , sharing imagery and parentage , until finally , Serket became said to be merely an aspect of Isis , whose cult had become very dominant .",

Shorter is convinced that one particular scene in a movie he recently saw was too realistic to have been staged with fake blood , but when Pascoe starts investigating , he soon comes across the actress in question , Linda Abbott , who obviously did n't suffer from any harm and assures Pascoe that his and Shorter 's concerns are unnecessary . Meanwhile , the `` Calli '' has been vandalised and its proprietor Gilbert Haggard has been assaulted so badly that he succumbs to a heart attack . The only existing copy of `` Droit de Seigneur '' - the film Jack Shorter was so worried about - has been destroyed , and when 13-year-old Sandra Burkill accuses the dentist of being the father of her ( yet unborn ) child , it begins to look as if Shorter had merely tried to avert suspicions by his claims against the `` Calli '' . \n \n Publication history \n \n * 1978 , London : Collins Crime Club ISBN 0-00-231643-9 , Pub date February 1978 , Hardback \n \n Television Adaptation \n \n The novel was adapted for television in 1994 and starred Gareth Hale as Dalziel and Norman Pace as Pascoe . It was shown on the ITV network in three parts over consecutive Saturdays beginning on 9 April . However , Reginald Hill is said to have been unhappy with the series and it subsequently remains the only one to star Hale and Pace in the leading roles .

Located in Hudson Bay , the Belcher Islands are spread out over almost 3000 km2 . The hamlet of Sanikiluaq ( where the majority of the archipelago 's inhabitants live ) is on the north coast of Flaherty Island and is the southernmost in Nunavut . Along with Flaherty Island , the other large islands are Kugong Island , Tukarak Island , and Innetalling Island . Other main islands in the 1,500 island archipelago are Moore Island , Wiegand Island , Split Island , Snape Island and Mavor Island , while island groups include the Sleeper Islands , King George Islands , and Bakers Dozen Islands . \n \n History \n \n Before 1914 , English-speaking cartographers knew very little about the Belcher Islands , which they showed on maps as specks , much smaller than their true extent . In that year a map showing them , drawn by George Weetaltuk , came into the hands of Robert Flaherty , and cartographers began to represent them more accurately . The islands are named for Royal Navy Admiral Sir Edward Belcher ( 1799-1877 ) . \n \n Geology \n \n The geologic units of the Belcher Islands are Proterozoic in age . The exposed clastic sedimentary rocks , as well as volcanic and carbonate units record rifting and subsidence of the Superior craton during this period . There are two main volcanic sequences on the Belcher Islands called the Eskimo and overlying Flaherty volcanics . These volcanics form part of the Circum-Superior Belt . \n \n Flora \n \n Other than in valley regions , trees can not grow on the islands because of a lack of adequate soil . \n \n Fauna \n \n The main wildlife consists of belugas , walrus , caribou , common eiders and snowy owls all which can be seen on the island year round . There is also a wide variety of fish that can be caught such as Arctic char , cod , capelin , lump fish , and sculpin . The historical relationship between the Sanikiluaq community and the eider is the subject of a feature length Canadian documentary film called People of a Feather . The director , cinematographer and biologist Joel Heath spent seven years on the project , writing biological articles on the eider . \n \n In 1998 the Belcher Island caribou ( Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus ) herd numbered 800 .",

Instead the salmon is `` buried '' in a dry marinade of salt , sugar , and dill , and cured for a few days . As the salmon cures , by the action of osmosis , the moisture turns the dry cure into a highly concentrated brine , which can be used in Scandinavian cooking as part of a sauce . This same method of curing can be employed for any fatty fish , but salmon is the most commonly used . \n \n Gravlax can be cured with salt , dill , beetroot , and is often eaten on rye bread .",

Its collection consists of works and articles by Munch , which he donated to the municipality of Oslo upon his death , and additional works donated by his sister Inger Munch , as well as various other works obtained through trades of duplicate prints , etc . \n \n The museum now has in its permanent collection well over half of the artist 's entire production of paintings and at least one copy of all his prints . This amounts to over 1,200 paintings , 18,000 prints , six sculptures , as well as 500 plates , 2,240 books , and various other items . The museum also contains educational and conservation sections , and has facilities for the performing arts . \n \n The museum structure was designed by the architects Einar Myklebust and Gunnar Fougner ( 1911–1995 ) . Myklebust also played an important role in the expansion and renovation of the museum in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of Munch 's death . This site has also been the location of filming for an Olsenbanden-movie from 1984 . The City of Oslo promoted an architectural competition for a new Munch Museum in the area of Bjørvika , a new urban development were the Oslo Opera House is also located . The new museum will probably be completed in 2018 by the Spanish studio Herreros Arquitectos . \n \n Theft of The Scream \n \n On Sunday , 22 August 2004 , two paintings by Munch , The Scream and Madonna , were stolen from the Munch Museum by masked men wielding firearms . The robbers forced the museum guards to lie down on the floor while they snapped the cable securing the paintings to the wall and escaped in a black Audi A6 station wagon , which police later found abandoned . The paintings were recovered by Oslo Police on August 31 , 2006 . For more details on the theft see The Scream . \n \n Plans for the museum 's future \n \n The City of Oslo promoted an architectural competition in 2008 for a new Munch Museum in the area of Bjørvika , a new urban development where the Oslo Opera House is also located . The competition was won in 2009 by the Spanish studio Herreros Arquitectos with its project Lambda . Before the local election in Oslo in 2011 , the Oslo Progress Party decided that they would no longer support building Lambda due to economic concerns . After the election , in December 2011 , the Oslo City Council voted to end the Lambda project . Instead the council wanted to consider improving the current museum or moving the collection to Nasjonalgalleriet . In May 2013 , the Oslo City Council finally took the decision to revive the Lambda project , and move the museum to its new site on the waterfront , next to the Opera House . The new museum is expected to open in 2018 .",

They belong to different families of instruments and can cover a wide range of musical roles . Since producing low pitches usually requires a long air column or string , the string and wind bass instruments are usually the largest instruments in their families or instrument classes . \n \n As seen in the musical instrument classification article , categorizing instruments can be difficult . For example , some instruments fall into more than one category . The cello is considered a tenor instrument in some orchestral settings , but in a string quartet it is the bass instrument . \n \n Examples grouped by general form and playing technique include : \n * Double bass from the viol or violin family ( usually the instrument referred to as a `` bass '' in European classical music and jazz . Sometimes called a `` string bass '' to differentiate it from a `` brass bass '' or `` bass horn '' , or an `` upright bass '' to differentiate it from a `` bass guitar '' ) \n * Bass guitar and acoustic bass guitar , instruments shaped , constructed and held ( or worn ) like guitars , that play in the bass range . The electric bass guitar is usually the instrument referred to as a `` bass '' in pop and rock music . \n * A bass horn , such as a tuba , serpent , and sousaphone from the wind family and low-tuned versions of specific types of brass and woodwind instruments , such as bassoon , bass clarinet , bass trombone and bass saxophone , etc . ( less common usage ) \n * Keyboard bass , a keyboard alternative to the bass guitar or double bass ( e.g . the Fender Rhodes piano bass in the 1960s or 13-note MIDI keyboard controllers in the 2000s ) \n * Washtub bass , a simple folk instrument \n * Bass drum \n \n A musician playing one of these instruments is often known as a bassist .

The species is resident only in warmer areas , but migrates north in spring , and sometimes again in autumn . \n \n This medium-sized butterfly is identified by its striking dark brown , red , and black wing pattern . More specifically , the dark wings possess orange bands that cross the fore wings and on the outer edge of the hind wings ; white spots on the dorsal fore wings near the front margin ; reddish bars on dorsal surface of all four wings . The caterpillar feeds on nettles , and the adult drinks from flowering plants like the Buddleia and overripe fruit . \n \n In northern Europe , it is one of the last butterflies to be seen before winter sets in , often feeding on the flowers of ivy on sunny days . The Red Admiral is also known to hibernate , re-emerging individuals showing prominently darker colourings than first brood subjects . The butterfly also flies on sunny winter days , especially in southern Europe . \n \n In North America , the Red Admiral generally has two broods from March through October . Most of North America must be recolonized each spring by southern migrants , but this species over-winters in south Texas . \n \n The Red Admiral is the butterfly featured by Vladimir Nabokov , an amateur lepidopterist , in his novel Pale Fire . \n \n Life cycle \n \n Egg-butterfly-vulcan-oeuf-papillon-vulcain-vanessa-atalanta-2.jpg|Eggs \n Vanessa.atalanta.caterpillars.jpg|Early instar \n Vanessa atalanta Raupe ( HS ) .jpg|Late instar \n Chrysalis-butterfly-vulcan-chrysalide-papillon-vulcain-vanessa-atalanta-2.jpg|Chrysalis \n Vanessa atalanta MHNT CUT 2013 3 14 Grisolle Dos.jpg|Dorsal side \n Vanessa atalanta MHNT CUT 2013 3 14 Grisolle ventre.jpg| △ ventral side \n \n Host Plants \n \n Plants of the nettle family ( Urticaceae ) including stinging nettle ( Urtica dioica ) , tall wild nettle ( U. d. gracilis ) , wood nettle ( Laportea canadensis ) , false nettle ( Boehmeria cylindrica ) , pellitory ( Parietaria pennsylvanica ) , mamaki ( Pipturus albidus ) , and possibly hops ( Humulus ) \n \n Etymology \n \n Atalanta is a figure in Greek mythology , a strong yet feminine woman who faces obstacles and backlash for refusing to follow gender norms .",

Combs help to clean and remove tangles from the hair , and are a symbol of cleanliness . Combing their hair reminds Sikhs that their lives should be tidy and organized . \n \n History \n \n The Sikhs were mandated by Guru Gobind Singh at the Baisakhi Amrit Sanchar in 1699 to wear a small comb called a Kanga at all times . Kanga must be worn by all baptised Sikhs ( Khalsa ) , after a mandatory religious commandment given by Guru Gobind Singh ( the tenth Guru of Sikhism ) in 1699 . \n This was one of five articles of faith , collectively called Kakars that form the external visible symbols to clearly and outwardly display one 's commitment and dedication to the order ( Hukam ) of the tenth master and become a member of Khalsa . The Khalsa is the `` Saint-Soldier '' of Guru Gobind Singh who stated : \n \n `` He does not recognize anyone else except One Lord , not even the bestowal of charities , performance of merciful acts , austerities and restraint on pilgrim-stations ; the perfect light of the Lord illuminates his heart , then consider him as the immaculate Khalsa . '' ( Guru Gobind Singh in the Dasam Granth page 1350 ) \n \n The Kanga is an article that allows the Sikh to care for his or her unshorn long hair , Kesh . The kanga is usually tucked behind the `` Rishi Knot '' and tied under the turban . It is to be used twice daily to comb and keep the hair in a disentangled and tidy condition . It represents the importance of discipline and cleanliness to a Sikh way of life and is used to keep the hair healthy , clean , shining and tangle-free . The Kanga is tucked under the rishi knot to keep the rishi knot firm and in place .",

By the 1850s , the area around Duke Street and China Street had become populated during the rapid development of the Potteries . \n \n Potters settled in Fenton in large houses alongside their pot-banks . Such houses include Great Fenton Hall , Fenton House ( home of the Baker family ) , Heron Cottage and Grove House . \n \n The two principal districts , Fenton Vivian and Fenton Culvert – each with their scattered communities , were brought together to make an urban district with its own board of guardians in 1894 . \n \n On 1 April 1910 , the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent . By 1925 the area was granted city status . \n \n Industry \n \n Fenton has been the home of a number of potteries such as Coalport and Baker & Co , and its architectural heritage includes listed bottle ovens . \n \n WW I \n \n During the First World War Fenton was bombed by Zeppelin ' L 21 ' . \n \n Geography \n \n It is within easy reach of the A500 , A34 and the A50 , a short distance away from Longton , Hanley and Newcastle . \n \n Suburbs \n \n Although Fenton has large industrial plants , particularly from the Potteries trade , it has always been considered more of a residential area . \n \n Fenton includes Heron Cross , Mount Pleasant , Saxonfields , Pool Dole and Fenpark . \n \n Places of interest \n \n Old Town Hall , Fenton \n Fenton Manor has a swimming pool , gym and fitness centre , and a 1,300-seater arena . Fenton Park has football pitches , pavilions and playground . The town ’ s library on Baker Street , a Carnegie library , is now closed . Fenton also had a magistrates court , which served the city from within Fenton ’ s old town hall , built in 1888 by local pottery owner William Meath Baker at his own expense , to a design by Robert Scrivener . It closed in 2013 . \n \n Economy \n \n Fenton differs from the other Potteries towns in that it doesn ’ t have a town centre . Instead , amenities and shops are spread over a sizeable area . \n \n Notable people \n \n * Frank Bough \n * Paul Bown \n * Ryan Shotton \n * Richard Bolton \n * Edward Bolton \n \n Trivia \n \n In the Jorge Luis Borges short story The Garden of Forking Paths , Dr. Yu Tsun goes to a suburb of Fenton to meet Stephen Albert .",

Schnyder and Oechslin would aim to produce complication timepieces using modern materials and manufacturing techniques . \n \n In 2014 , Ulysse Nardin was acquired by the Kering Group , formerly known as PPR . \n \n Trilogy of Time \n \n The first advancement of the company was the `` Trilogy of Time '' . This collection incorporated three different astrological pieces starting in 1985 with the release of the Astrolabium Galileo Galilei . The Astrolabium displays local and solar time , the orbits and eclipses of the sun and the moon and the positions of several major stars . It was named by the Guinness Book of Records in 1989 as the world 's most-functional watch ( with 21 distinct functions ) . Dr. Oechslin then followed the Astrolabium up with two other astronomical watches : in 1988 the Planetarium Copernicus ( named after the stargazing theaters called planetariums and of astronomer Copernicus ) and in 1992 the Tellurium Johannes Kepler ( named after the element tellurium and astronomer Johannes Kepler ) . \n \n Image : Ulysse-Nardin MG 2569.jpg|Planetarium Copernicus \n Image : Ulysse-Nardin MG 2565.jpg|Astrolabium Galileo Galilei \n Image : Ulysse-Nardin MG 2566.jpg|Tellurium Johannes Kepler \n \n Sponsorships \n \n In 2015 , Ulysse Nardin announced its partnership with Team Artemis in the 2017 America 's Cup .",

This can apply to people , places , or things that promise to be more than they really are . The expression , in various forms , originated in or before the 12th century and may date back to Aesop . \n The Latin is Non omne quod nitet aurum est . \n \n Chaucer gave two early versions in English : `` But al thyng which that shyneth as the gold / Nis nat gold , as that I have herd it told '' in `` The Canon 's Yeoman 's Tale '' , and `` Hyt is not al golde that glareth '' in `` The House of Fame '' . \n \n The popular form of the expression is a derivative of a line in William Shakespeare 's play The Merchant of Venice , which employs the word `` glisters , '' a 17th-century synonym for `` glitters . '' The line comes from a secondary plot of the play , the puzzle of Portia 's boxes ( Act II - Scene VII - Prince of Morocco ) : \n \n Panning for gold often results in finding pyrite , nicknamed fool 's gold , which reflects substantially more light than authentic gold does . Gold in its raw form appears dull and does not glitter . \n The expression is also found in Yiddish ( nit als vos glanst iz gold ) , especially amongst Hasidim , and also appears in a Hebrew work of Mendele Mocher Sforim . \n \n In pop culture , this phrase shows up in Bob Marley 's `` Get Up , Stand Up '' . It is also used as lyrics in the song `` A Guided Masquerade '' by Alesana , in the song `` Domino Rain '' by Antemasque , in the song `` Gold '' by Prince , and \n in the Kanye West song , `` Family Business '' . \n \n `` Not all that glitters is gold '' is an alternative formulation . \n \n Another common formulation with the same meaning is `` All that shines is not gold '' , as seen in the title and refrain of the song `` All That Shines Is Not Gold '' and in the lyrics of `` Next Time You See Me '' as well as Curtis Mayfield 's `` That 's What Mama Say '' . \n \n The inverse of this expression , `` All that glitters is gold , '' is a lyric in the Led Zeppelin song , `` Stairway to Heaven '' , the Smash Mouth song , `` All Star '' , the Death in Vegas song , `` All That Glitters '' , and in the Future Islands song `` A Dream of You and Me '' followed by the lyric `` Do n't believe what you 've been told '' .",

It is a bronze medallion , bearing the words `` For Gallantry '' and `` We Also Serve '' within a laurel wreath , carried on a ribbon of striped green , dark brown , and pale blue . It is awarded to animals that have displayed `` conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units '' . The award is commonly referred to as `` the animals ' Victoria Cross '' ( although the Victoria Cross Trust has opposed this association ) . \n \n Maria Dickin was the founder of the People 's Dispensary for Sick Animals ( PDSA ) , a British veterinary charity . She established the award for any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with British Empire armed forces or civil emergency services . The medal was awarded 54 times between 1943 and 1949 – to 32 pigeons , 18 dogs , three horses , and one cat – to acknowledge actions of gallantry or devotion during the Second World War and subsequent conflicts . The awarding of the medal was revived in 2000 to honour Gander , a Newfoundland dog , who saved infantrymen during the Battle of Lye Mun . In early 2002 , the medal was given in honour of three dogs for their role responding to the September 11 attacks ; it was also awarded to two dogs serving with Commonwealth forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq . In December 2007 , 12 former recipients buried at the PDSA Animal Cemetery in Ilford , Essex , were afforded full military honours at the conclusion of a National Lottery-aided project to restore the cemetery . \n \n The first recipients of the award , in December 1943 , were three pigeons , serving with the Royal Air Force , all of whom contributed to the recovery of air crew from ditched aircraft during the Second World War . The most recent animal to be cited for the honour is Reckless , a horse who was injured while serving with the United States Marine Corps in the Korean War . As of April 2016 , the Dickin Medal has been awarded 67 times , with Diesel 's presentation to take place later in the year . \n \n Recipients",

The melody derived from band members ' riffs -- Basie rarely wrote down musical ideas , so Eddie Durham and Buster Smith helped him crystalize his ideas . The original 1937 recording of the tune by Basie and his band is noted for the saxophone work of Herschel Evans and Lester Young , trumpet by Buck Clayton , Walter Page on bass and Basie himself on piano . \n \n `` One O'Clock Jump '' became the theme song of the Count Basie Orchestra . They used it to close each of their concerts for the next half century . It was reportedly titled `` Blue Ball '' at first but a radio announcer feared that title was too risqué . \n \n Later , `` One O'Clock Jump '' was to be listed in the Songs of the Century . \n \n The song is typical of Basie 's early riff style . \n The instrumentation is based on `` head arrangements '' where each section makes up their part based on what the other sections are playing . \n Individuals take turns improvising over the top of the entire sound . Basie recorded `` One O'Clock Jump '' several times after the original performance for Decca in 1937 , for Columbia in 1942 and 1950 and on a number of occasions in the fifties . \n `` Two O'Clock Jump '' was a performance by Harry James and his big band in 1939 , slightly based on `` One O'Clock Jump '' but using triplets . Several versions of the original by Harry James and Benny Goodman feature the `` Two O'Clock Jump '' ending . Lionel Hampton used the song as his theme song for a while as well . Basie later released `` Jumpin ' at the Woodside '' in a similar style . \n \n A popular jazz standard for virtually all top swing bands and their fans and jitterbuggers , it was part of the concert bill for Benny Goodman 's famous 1938 concert at Carnegie Hall .

It is run at Chepstow , Wales , over a distance of about 3 miles and 5½ furlongs ( 5,934 metres ) , and during its running there are twenty-two fences to be jumped . It is a handicap race , and it is scheduled to take place each year late December . \n \n The race was first run in 1895 , and it originally took place at Ely Racecourse in Cardiff . It remained at this venue until the closure of the course in 1939 . After World War II it was transferred to Caerleon in 1948 , and it was then moved to its present venue in 1949 . Dick Francis , the famous jockey turned author , rode the first Chepstow winner of the race , Fighting Line . David Nicholson , later a successful racehorse trainer , rode three successive Welsh National winners in 1959 , 1960 and 1961 . \n \n Originally run on Easter Tuesday , it was moved to February in 1969 with the aim of attracting better horses , albeit with the increased risk of bad weather forcing its cancellation . It was moved to late December in 1979 , after that year 's original fixture was abandoned due to snow . The meeting is now held the day after Boxing Day and since then the class of runners has improved further , making it an informative guide to future races such as the Grand National and the Cheltenham Gold Cup . \n \n Among the winners were Burrough Hill Lad in 1983 , who went on to land the Tote Cheltenham Gold Cup less than three months later . Trainer Jenny Pitman had the previous season saddled Corbière to win the Welsh and Aintree Nationals . In the late 80s and early 90s , the race was dominated by Somerset trainer Martin Pipe . Bonanza Boy achieved consecutive successes in 1988 and 1989 , and in 1991 the giant Carvill 's Hill became one of the easiest winners in the history of the race . \n \n More recent winners of both the Welsh and the Aintree Grand National are Bindaree and Silver Birch .

It premiered on 5 November 2009 at the Lyttelton Theatre at the Royal National Theatre , with the central roles filled by Alex Jennings as Britten and Richard Griffiths as Auden ( the latter replacing Michael Gambon , who had to withdraw from the production due to minor ill health ) . The performance of April 22 , 2010 was broadcast to more than 200 cinemas worldwide by [ http : //www.ntlive.com NTLive ] . \n \n Synopsis \n \n `` The Habit of Art '' centres on Fitz , Henry , Tim and Donald , who are actors rehearsing a play called Caliban 's Day . ( The title reflects Auden 's view that The Tempest was incomplete and Caliban should have an epilogue . ) The director has been called away , so they have a run-through/workshop directed by the stage manager , Kay , in the presence of the playwright , Neil . \n \n `` Caliban 's Day '' is about a fictitious meeting in 1973 in Auden 's rooms at Oxford , between Auden ( Fitz ) in his latter years and Britten ( Henry ) . Auden has hired a rent boy , Stuart ( Tim ) and when Humphrey Carpenter ( Donald ) - who will write biographies of both Auden and Britten after their deaths - arrives to interview him , Auden mistakes him for Stuart . Britten has been auditioning boys for Death in Venice nearby , and arrives unexpectedly ( their first meeting in 25 years after they fell out over the failure of their opera Paul Bunyan ) . He wants to discuss his misgivings about the paedophilic theme of Death in Venice and the light that may cast on his own life , but Auden assumes Britten wants him to write the libretto . \n \n The characters intermittently break out of the rehearsal to discuss the play , how accurately/harshly it should treat Auden 's failings , the actor 's craft and many other issues raised by Auden , Britten and the play . In doing so , they reveal something of their own backgrounds .",

          "context": "The 800 metres , or 800 meters ( US spelling ) , is a common track running event . It is the shortest common middle-distance running event . The 800 metres is run over two laps of the track ( 400 metre track ) and has been an Olympic event since the first games in 1896 . During indoor track season the event is usually run on a 200-metre track , therefore requiring four laps . \n \n The event was derived from the imperial measurement of a half a mile ( 880 yards ) , a traditional English racing distance . Imperial racing distances were common in the United States . American high schools ( in the name of the NFHS ) were the last to convert to metric distances in 1980 , following the NCAA 's conversion in 1976 . Countries associated to the English system converted to metric distances after the 1966 Commonwealth Games . 800 m is 4.67 m less than half a mile . \n \n The event combines aerobic endurance with anaerobic conditioning and sprint speed . Both the aerobic and anaerobic systems are being taxed to a high extent , thus the 800 metre athlete is required to combine training between both systems . \n \n Runners in this event are often fast enough to compete in the 400 metres and/or the 4 × 400 metres relay but only Alberto Juantorena and Jarmila Kratochvílová have won major international titles at 400 m and 800 m. If they are so inclined , 400 m runners are usually encouraged to run the 200 metres while 800 m runners are encouraged to run the 1500 metres . \n \n Race tactics \n \n The 800 m event is also known for its tactical racing techniques . Because the 800 m event is the shortest event that has all the runners converge on lane one , positioning on the cut-in is critical to the outcome of the race . It is commonly believed that getting the first or second position early in the race is advantageous as these positions are not usually caught up in the pack . Olympic champions Dave Wottle , Yuriy Borzakovskiy and others have defied that logic by running a more evenly paced race , lagging behind the pack and kicking past the slowing early leaders . Often the winner of 800 m races at high levels are not determined by the strongest runner but instead by the athlete with the best positioning near the end of the race . This can lead to the most exciting aspect of the 800 m which is its high probability of an upset . \n \n All-time top 25 fastest \n \n Men \n \n As of July 2015 \n \n Women \n \n As of July 2016 . \n \n Juniors \n \n World junior records ( 19 and under ) are held by Nijel Amos ( 1:41.73 , London , 9 August 2012 ) and Pamela Jelimo ( 1:54.01 , Zürich , 29 August 2008 ) . Both marks coincidentally rank them as the third fastest ever . \n \n Olympic medalists \n \n Men \n \n Women \n \n World Championships medalists \n \n Men \n \n Women \n \n Season 's bests \n \n As of June 5 , 2015 \n \n Men \n \n Women",

Robin 's Nest aired for six series from 11 January 1977 to 31 March 1981 , and co-starred Tessa Wyatt as Robin 's girlfriend - and later wife - Vicky , and Tony Britton as her father . It was made by Thames Television and aired on network ITV . \n \n Format \n \n In the first episode Robin and Vicky , who share a flat over a Chinese take-away , discover that the tenants have disappeared owing rent to the landlord , Vicky 's father James Nichols . It is the practical Vicky who comes up with the perfect solution : Robin should take over the take-away and convert it into a bistro ( The `` Robin 's Nest '' of the title ) . Robin can not afford to go it alone so he has to go cap-in-hand to Vicky 's father , James Nicholls ( Tony Britton ) , to ask him to be his business partner . Although Nicholls disapproves of Robin ( believing him to be beneath his daughter ) , he knows a sensible business deal when it is offered to him – despite his failings , Robin is a brilliant chef – and he agrees . Lots of tension and misunderstandings are to arise from their mismatched relationship . \n \n Creators and writers Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer had to get special permission from the IBA ( the then governing body of Independent TV in Britain ) to be able to portray an unmarried couple living together ; special concern arose at scenes in which Robin and Vicky were seen in an obvious state of undress in bed . In 1978 , Robin and Vicky were married and later had a set of twins . \n \n Other characters \n \n Other characters included : \n \n * The one-armed Irish kitchen hand Albert Riddle ( David Kelly ) , who always broke more crockery than he cleaned , and who once asked Robin 's culinary advice ; unable to cook egg on toast , he asked Robin `` How do you stop the egg dribbling into the bottom of the toaster , Mr Tripp ? `` . \n * Vicky 's mother ( divorced from her father ) , would occasionally appear , played first by Honor Blackman , later by Barbara Murray . \n * Gertrude , Albert 's girlfriend , played by ex-Crossroads actress Peggy Aitchison . \n \n The show was remade in the United States as Three 's a Crowd , a spinoff to Three 's Company – originally based on Man About the House – but was unsuccessful .

Originally a Georgian farmhouse , it has Victorian and later additions , and was rebuilt after a fire in 1910 . It was given to the National Trust by Lord Courtauld-Thomson in 1947 as a country home for a senior member of the Government , usually a Secretary of State or Minister of the Crown . The Dorneywood Trust has the objective of 'maintaining the mansion house and gardens of Dorneywood ' . \n \n Occupancy of the house \n \n The Prime Minister alone decides which Minister or Secretary of State is to occupy the house . In previous administrations it has been the residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and , prior to 31 May 2006 , was occupied by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott . Prescott was forced to relinquish occupancy of Dorneywood , following a series of scandals over an affair with civil servant Tracey Temple and a snatched paparazzi photograph of him playing croquet on the lawn of the property whilst the Prime Minister Tony Blair was out of the country on a visit to Washington . However , given the controversies over John Prescott 's use of the house , senior politicians were reluctant to use it . The house was eventually taken over by Alistair Darling , Chancellor of the Exchequer when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in 2007 . `` A spokesman for Mr Brown ... explained that the house ... was owned by a trust , and would revert first to the Lord Mayor of London and then to the American Ambassador , if the Chancellor did not want it '' . \n \n Various former Prime Ministers ( before achieving the premiership ) have occupied the house , among them Anthony Eden ; he and his wife had disliked the house . However , on becoming Prime Minister , Alec Douglas-Home was reluctant to forsake the more comfortable and modern Dorneywood for the antique splendours of Chequers . Another , James Callaghan as Foreign Secretary , also had the use of Dorneywood ( later Chevening was to become the official country home for the holder of that office ) . The last person to have lived at the house before becoming Prime Minister was John Major . \n \n In 2010 , George Osborne , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , took occupancy of the house . \n \n Dorneywood is now used by Osborne 's successor , Philip Hammond . \n \n Interior \n \n The interior of the house contains some decorations by Rex Whistler , as well as paintings and furniture belonging to the Government Art Collection . There is also furniture belonging to the National Trust . The house is only open to the public on selected dates . \n \n Grounds \n \n The National Trust markets the property under the name `` Dorneywood Garden '' . The estate consists of the house and 215 acres of parkland , woodland and farmland . The 1930s-style gardens are open to the public on selected dates during the summer . The grounds are noted for their cottage and kitchen garden , as well as their herbaceous borders and rose displays . The upkeep of the estate is in part supported by the Dorneywood Thomson Endowment Trust Fund .",

Formed in 1967 , the party sought Crown dependency status for the Isle of Wight , on a similar model to certain other islands including the Isle of Man . They were motivated by a belief that the sale of the Isle of Wight to the English crown in 1293 was unconstitutional . \n \n The party contested the Isle of Wight constituency in the 1970 general election when candidate R. W. J. Cawdell , a councillor for Ryde , polled 1,607 votes ( 2.8 % of the Wight vote ) . The party led it to undertake symbolic direct action , such as an intra-island postal service during the 1971 postal strike . That year it narrowly lost a local government election . It also led campaigns for the establishment of an Isle of Wight specific radio service and for a regional television service . The party 's failure to convince the electorate to break from the traditional parties however led to disillusionment amongst members and by the mid 1970s the party had been wound up . \n \n In 2006 , Ray Stokes attempted to revive the VNP , emphasizing two aspects : an economically opportunistic deployment of islandness and a conservative , nostalgic impulse . The party was opposed to housing development that would lead to increased migration to the island , and to a fixed link to the island of Great Britain .

Examples include technetium-95 and promethium-146 . Many of these are found in , and harvested from , spent nuclear fuel assemblies . Some must be manufactured in particle accelerators . \n \n Production \n \n Some synthetic radioisotopes are extracted from spent nuclear reactor fuel rods , which contain various fission products . For example , it is estimated that up to 1994 , about 49,000 TBq ( 78 metric ton ) of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors , which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium . However , only a fraction of the production is used commercially . Other synthetic isotopes are produced in significant quantities by fission but are not yet being reclaimed . Other isotopes are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes in a nuclear reactor ( for example , Tc-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of Ru-96 ) or by bombarding parent isotopes with high energy particles from a particle accelerator . \n \n Uses \n \n Most synthetic radioisotopes are extremely radioactive and have a short half-life . Though a health hazard , radioactive materials have many medical and industrial uses . \n \n Nuclear medicine \n \n The general field of nuclear medicine covers any use of radioisotopes for \n diagnosis or treatment . \n \n Diagnosis \n \n Radioactive tracer compounds are used to observe the function of various organs and body systems . These compounds use a chemical tracer which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied . That chemical tracer incorporates a short lived radioactive isotope , usually one which emits a gamma ray which is energetic enough to travel through \n the body and be captured outside by a gamma camera to map the concentrations . Gamma cameras and other similar detectors are highly efficient , and the tracer compounds are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest , so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small . \n \n The metastable nuclear isomer Tc-99m is a Gamma-emitter widely used for medical diagnostics because it has a short half-life of 6 hours , but can be easily made in the hospital using a `` technetium-cow '' . \n \n Treatment \n \n Radiopharmaceuticals are any of a number of compounds using a radioisotope for medical treatment , usually by bringing the radioactive isotope to a high concentration in the body near a particular organ . For example , iodine-131 is used for treating some disorders and tumors of the thyroid gland . \n \n Industrial radiation sources \n \n Alpha particle , beta particle , and gamma ray radioactive emissions are industrially useful . Most sources of these are synthetic radioisotopes . \n \n * more information needed \n \n Footnotes",

Cassiterite has been the chief tin ore throughout ancient history and remains the most important source of tin today . \n \n Occurrence \n \n Most sources of cassiterite today are found in alluvial or placer deposits containing the resistant weathered grains . The best sources of primary cassiterite are found in the tin mines of Bolivia , where it is found in hydrothermal veins . Rwanda has a nascent cassiterite mining industry . Fighting over cassiterite deposits ( particularly in Walikale ) is a major cause of the conflict waged in eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . This has led to cassiterite being considered a conflict mineral . \n \n Cassiterite is a widespread minor constituent of igneous rocks . The Bolivian veins and the old exhausted workings of Cornwall , England , are concentrated in high temperature quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives . The veins commonly contain tourmaline , topaz , fluorite , apatite , wolframite , molybdenite , and arsenopyrite . The mineral occurs extensively in Cornwall as surface deposits on Bodmin Moor , for example , where there are extensive traces of an hydraulic mining method known as streaming . The current major tin production comes from placer or alluvial deposits in Malaysia , Thailand , Indonesia , the Maakhir region of Somalia , and Russia . Hydraulic mining methods are used to concentrate mined ore , a process which relies on the high specific gravity of the SnO2 ore , of about 7.0 . \n \n Crystallography \n \n Crystal twinning is common in cassiterite and most aggregate specimens show crystal twins . The typical twin is bent at a near-60-degree angle , forming an `` elbow twin '' . Botryoidal or reniform cassiterite is called wood tin . \n \n Cassiterite is also used as a gemstone and collector specimens when quality crystals are found . \n \n Etymology \n \n The name derives from the Greek kassiteros for `` tin '' ; or from the Phoenician word Cassiterid referring to the islands of Ireland and Britain , the ancient sources of tin ; or , as Roman Ghirshman ( 1954 ) suggests , from the region of the Kassites , an ancient people in west and central Iran .",

In a polygon , an edge is a line segment on the boundary , and is often called a side . In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope , an edge is a line segment where two faces meet . A segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal . \n \n Relation to edges in graphs \n \n In graph theory , an edge is an abstract object connecting two graph vertices , unlike polygon and polyhedron edges which have a concrete geometric representation as a line segment . \n However , any polyhedron can be represented by its skeleton or edge-skeleton , a graph whose vertices are the geometric vertices of the polyhedron and whose edges correspond to the geometric edges . Conversely , the graphs that are skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra can be characterized by Steinitz 's theorem as being exactly the 3-vertex-connected planar graphs . \n \n Number of edges in a polyhedron \n \n Any convex polyhedron 's surface has Euler characteristic \n \n V - E + F = 2 , \n \n where V is the number of vertices , E is the number of edges , and F is the number of faces . This equation is known as Euler 's polyhedron formula . Thus the number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces . For example , a cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces , and hence 12 edges . \n \n Incidences with other faces \n \n In a polygon , two edges meet at each vertex ; more generally , by Balinski 's theorem , at least d edges meet at every vertex of a d-dimensional convex polytope . \n Similarly , in a polyhedron , exactly two two-dimensional faces meet at every edge , while in higher dimensional polytopes three or more two-dimensional faces meet at every edge . \n \n Alternative terminology \n \n In the theory of high-dimensional convex polytopes , a facet or side of a d-dimensional polytope is one of its ( d − 1 ) -dimensional features , a ridge is a ( d − 2 ) -dimensional feature , and a peak is a ( d − 3 ) -dimensional feature . Thus , the edges of a polygon are its facets , the edges of a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron are its ridges , and the edges of a 4-dimensional polytope are its peaks ..",

          "context": "Turton and Entwistle Reservoir is a water reservoir in the village of Edgworth , Lancashire . The reservoir 's existence is due to the Entwistle Dam . When constructed in 1832 the Entwistle Dam was the highest in Britain ; it rises 108 feet from the base . The reservoir contains almost 750 thousand imperial gallons ( roughly 3,400,000 litres ) and , with the Wayoh Reservoir just below , satisfies around 50 % of Bolton 's need for drinking water . \n \n Entwistle Dam was designed by Thomas Ashworth , a local land surveyor , overseen by Jesse Hartley , the Liverpool Docks engineer . Other works were by Joseph Jackson , an engineer and surveyor from Bolton . It was built for the Commissioners of the Turton and Entwistle Reservoir , a group of local mill owners who obtained an enabling Act of Parliament in 1832 to regulate the supply of water in Bradshaw Brook for water power for the finishing textiles . \n \n Records suggest it was built entirely of puddle clay with no distinct core . Earth dams usually have a waterproof cutoff under their earthworks designed to stop seepage under the dam but it is doubtful whether there was any such a cutoff at Entwistle . The reservoir has a rock-cut outlet tunnel driven through the valley side rather than a culvert or pipeline and a siphon draw-off pipe . The dam is 108 ft high and 110 metres long at the crest . The present overflow channel and valve tower were added by the Bolton Corporation Water Works who took over the reservoir in 1864 .",

There he was besieged by over 150,000 Prussian troops of the First and Second Armies on 19 August . The French attempted to break the siege first at Noisseville and again at Bellevue but were repulsed each time . \n \n Prelude \n \n Napoleon III and MacMahon formed the new French Army of Châlons , to march on to Metz to rescue Bazaine . Napoleon III personally led the army with Marshal MacMahon in attendance . The Army of Châlons marched north-east towards the Belgian border to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine . The Prussians , under the command of Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke , took advantage of this maneuver to catch the French in a pincer grip . He left the Prussian First and Second Armies besieging Metz , except three corps detached to form the Army of the Meuse under the Crown Prince of Saxony . With this army and the Prussian Third Army , Moltke marched northward and caught up with the French at Beaumont on 30 August . After a sharp fight in which they lost 5,000 men and 40 cannons , the French withdrew toward Sedan . Having reformed in the town , the Army of Châlons was immediately isolated by the converging Prussian armies . Napoleon III ordered the army to break out of the encirclement immediately . With MacMahon wounded on the previous day , General Auguste Ducrot took command of the French troops in the field . The Army of Châlons was trapped and destroyed at the Battle of Sedan . \n \n Siege \n \n Bazaine was forced to surrender his entire army on 27 October because of starvation . The Prussians offered the honors of war to the defeated French army , but , contrary to usual practice , Bazaine refused the honor . \n \n Prince Friedrich Karl and the Prussian Second Army were now free to move against the French force in the Loire River area . The siege is commemorated by the `` Siegesmarsch von Metz '' which uses parts of the `` Die Wacht am Rhein '' . One notable figure present on the Prussian side was the prominent philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , who served as a medical attendant . Nietzsche contracted both diphtheria and dysentery during the siege , worsening his already poor state of health .",

He was overcome by Heracles . The following day , Jason and the Argonauts passed by on their chthonic return journey from Colchis and heard the lament of `` shining '' Aegle , one of the four Hesperides , and viewed the still-twitching Ladon . \n \n Ladon was given several parentages , each of which placed him at an archaic level in Greek myth : the offspring of `` Ceto , joined in heated passion with Phorcys '' or of Typhon , who was himself serpent-like from the waist down , and Echidna or of Gaia herself , or Hera : `` The Dragon which guarded the golden apples was the brother of the Nemean lion '' asserted Ptolemy Hephaestion . In one version , Heracles did not kill Ladon . \n \n The image of the dragon ( Ladon ) coiled round the tree , originally adopted by the Hellenes from Near Eastern and Minoan sources , is familiar from surviving Greek vase-painting . In the 2nd century CE , Pausanias saw among the treasuries at Olympia an archaic cult image in cedar-wood of Heracles and the apple-tree of the Hesperides with the dragon coiled around it . \n \n Diodorus Siculus gives an euhemerist interpretation of Ladon , as a human shepherd guarding a flock of golden-fleeced sheep , adding `` But with regards to such matters it will be every man ’ s privilege to form such opinions as accord with his own belief '' . \n \n Ladon is the constellation Draco , according to Hyginus ' Astronomy .

          "context": "' ( Be still , stop chattering ) , BWV 211 , also known as the Coffee Cantata , is a secular cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed it probably between 1732 and 1735 . Although classified as a cantata , it is essentially a miniature comic opera . In a satirical commentary , the cantata amusingly tells of an addiction to coffee . \n \n History and text \n \n Bach regularly directed a musical ensemble based at Zimmermann 's coffee house called a collegium musicum , founded by Georg Philipp Telemann in 1702 . The libretto suggests that some people in eighteenth-century Germany viewed coffee drinking as a bad habit . However , the work is likely to have been first performed at the coffee house in Leipzig . \n \n The cantata 's libretto ( written by Christian Friedrich Henrici , known as Picander ) , features lines like `` If I could n't , three times a day , be allowed to drink my little cup of coffee , in my anguish I will turn into a shriveled-up roast goat '' . \n \n Bach wrote no operas : the cantata was written for concert performance , but is frequently performed today fully staged with costumes . \n \n Scoring \n \n The work is scored for three vocal soloists in the roles \n * Narrator , tenor \n * Schlendrian ( literally : Stick in the Mud ) , bass \n * Lieschen , his daughter , soprano . \n \n The orchestra consists of flauto traverso , two violins obbligato , viola , cembalo and basso continuo . \n \n Movements \n \n Recordings \n \n * Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir , Ton Koopman .

( Another theory places the location as an extant house in the nearby village of Brownsover . ) Sheriff was apprenticed by his father to a London grocer named William Walcott , at which point he went to London . His apprenticeship ended in 1541 , and he became a London grocer during the reign of King Henry VIII . In 1554 he was elected to the 'Worshipful Company of Grocers ' . \n \n Sheriff became grocer to many of the great and good of the day including Princess ( later Queen ) Elizabeth . He became trusted by the Queen and rose to the rank of gentleman , whereupon he was granted a coat of arms , the main feature of which is a griffin , the traditional guardian of treasures . He bought extensive property near London and in the area of Rugby and Brownsover . \n \n He earned a great fortune through his life , but remained childless , and upon his death in 1567 , he stipulated in his will that his fortune should be used to found almshouses and a school `` to serve chiefly for the children of Rugby and Brownsover ... and next for such as be of other places hereunto adjoyneing . '' This endowment was not fully realized , however , for some time , due to a challenge over the provisions of the will from the Howkins family , to whom Sheriff was related through his sister , Bridget . \n \n He was buried at the old Grey Friars Church in Newgate Street , London . However no trace remains : the church and all its monuments were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 . He is remembered today by the Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby . Both Rugby School and the Lawrence Sheriff School use versions of the coat of arms granted to Lawrence Sheriff in 1559 .",

He was publican of the Nag 's Head and appeared in the show from 1983 to 1996 . Mike was portrayed by Kenneth MacDonald . \n \n Mike first appeared in Only Fools and Horses in the episode , Who 's a Pretty Boy ? , in which Del ingratiated himself with the new landlord by agreeing to a deal which would see Mike accept Del 's £2000 offer to re-decorate the pub , leaving them with £500 apiece and using the remaining £1000 to pay Brendan O ' Shaugnassy . With many scenes in subsequent episodes set in the Nag 's Head , Mike became a regular character . \n \n Good-natured but often gullible , Mike was often on the receiving end of Del 's scams or attempts to sell his low-quality goods . He rarely managed to get to Del to pay off his bar tab or even to pay for his drinks as he ordered them ( instead putting them on the 'slate ' . He later comments that it 's gotten so far out of hand he could retile the roof with them ) . Among the goods he bought from Del were a hairdryer which was actually a paint stripper ( leaving Mike with severe burns to the head ) , a deep fryer ( which soon exploded ) and a fax machine which did n't work . On the other hand , he was quite happy to con people out of their money when he could , evidenced by one occasion where he sold Denzil a plate of stew for a pound , then sold exactly the same thing to a yuppie for £2.50 , instead calling it `` Boeuf Bourguignon . '' \n \n When Kenneth MacDonald died in 2001 , writer John Sullivan added a storyline to new episode If They Could See Us Now , which explained that Mike had been caught up in Del and Rodney 's shady financial dealings and attempted to embezzle the brewery in order to cover his losses , for which he was imprisoned .

It is most commonly served over ice . A Rusty Nail served without ice is sometimes called a Straight Up Nail . \n \n Variations \n \n Versions of the drink can be made using any aged spirit , though blended Scotch whisky is traditional . \n \n Other variations include : \n * The Rusty Bob , which substitutes Bourbon whisky for blended Scotch whisky \n * The Rusty Ale , in which a shot of Drambuie is added to any beer , served without ice . \n * The Smoky Nail , which uses Islay whisky ( very smoky in flavor ) in place of blended Scotch whisky . \n * The Clavo Ahumado ( Spanish for `` smoky nail '' ) , using mezcal instead of blended Scotch whisky . \n * The Railroad Spike , often served at brunch and made with approximately four parts Cold brew coffee to one part Drambuie in a tall glass over ice . \n * The Donald Sutherland , which substitutes Canadian rye whisky for blended Scotch whisky . \n \n History \n \n According to cocktail historian David Wondrich , `` the Rusty Nail took a while to find its proper place in the world . '' The combination of Drambuie— '' the world 's most distinguished Scotch-based liqueur '' —and the whisky it is made from first appears in 1937 in the form of the B.I.F. , credited to one F. Benniman and ostensibly named after the British Industries Fair . Wondrich goes on to note that `` it took another generation or so for the drink to assume its classic name and form , during which time it tried on several identities . Here it 's a D & S ... there a Little Club No . 1 ( the Little Club being a rather swank sort of joint on East Fifty-fifth Street much haunted by showbiz types ) ; at USAF Officers ' Clubs in Thailand and the Republic of Viet-Nam , it 's a Mig-21 , while in the upper Midwest it 's a Knucklehead . '' \n \n The cocktail authority Dale DeGroff notes , `` the Rusty Nail is often credited to the clever bartenders at the 21 Club in Manhattan sometime in the early 1960s . '' The cocktail 's name was finally cemented in 1963 , when Gina MacKinnon , the chairwoman of the Drambuie Liqueur Company , gave the Rusty Nail her endorsement in The New York Times . DeGroff observes that in the early 1960s `` the Rat Pack was enamored of the drink , which may have been responsible for the wide appeal in those years . '' \n \n Cultural references \n \n The cocktail is poured and commonly drunk by character Saul Goodman of the acclaimed AMC series , `` Breaking Bad , '' and `` Better Call Saul . '' \n \n It is also a preferred drink by the character Tony Blundetto in `` The Sopranos '' .",

Church attended film school at NYU and was a founding member of a group called Irving in 1998 . Many of the songs he wrote as a member of Irving did n't fit the group 's style , so Church began performing as Sea Wolf with a rotating ensemble of backing musicians , playing locally in Los Angeles and recording demos in Seattle with producer Phil Ek . Sea Wolf signed to Dangerbird Records in 2007 and released the Get To The River Before It Runs Too Low EP and a full-length titled Leaves In The River . The latter hit No . 24 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart . Church named the band after a Jack London Book , saying that he identifies with the main character , a sea captain who is a `` self-taught , blue-collar intellectual guy . '' \n \n On September 22 , 2009 , Sea Wolf 's second album , White Water , White Bloom was released by Dangerbird Records . The album was produced by Mike Mogis at his studio in Omaha . Sea Wolf contributed a song entitled `` Song of the Magpie '' to the audio book for Augusten Burroughs ' book `` A Wolf at the Table '' . Burroughs asked Sea Wolf ’ s Alex Brown Church to read the book and respond with an original song . Sea Wolf also wrote a song titled `` The Violet Hour '' in 2009 for the second part of the Twilight movie series , New Moon . \n \n Following the release of Old World Romance in 2012 , Church and company toured extensively before returning to the Sea Wolf studio in late 2013 to write and record an experimental 'stripped down ' album , which would eventually be titled Song Spells , No . 1 : Cedarsmoke . The album was meant to explore the sonic landscape and feel of the earliest Sea Wolf songs while also providing an outlet for Church to experiment with new ideas and working methods . Geared toward existing fans of the band , the album was not intended as the next 'official ' label-backed studio album , and was funded through a highly successful Kickstarter campaign . During the 4 month process of writing and recording the album , the idea of the series came about , and while it was never intended to be released on a wide scale , soon after its completion it was announced that this first entry in the series would be 'given back to fans ' by releasing it exclusively through music streaming services and as a pay-what-you-wish download on the band 's website . \n \n In addition to Alex Brown Church , the other members of Sea Wolf are currently Lisa Fendelander ( keyboards ) , Joey Ficken ( drums ) , Scott Leahy ( guitar ) and Eliot Lorango ( bass ) . \n \n Discography \n \n * Get To The River Before It Runs Too Low ( EP ) ( Dangerbird Records , 2007 ) \n * Leaves in the River ( Dangerbird , 2007 ) \n * White Water , White Bloom ( Dangerbird , 2009 ) \n * Old World Romance ( Dangerbird , 2012 ) \n * Song Spells , No . 1 : Cedarsmoke ( self-released , 2014 )",

          "context": "The patellar reflex or knee-jerk ( American spelling knee reflex ) is a stretch reflex which tests the L2 , L3 , and L4 segments of the spinal cord . \n \n Mechanism \n \n Striking the patellar ligament with a reflex hammer just below the patella stretches the muscle spindle in the quadriceps muscle . This produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses ( without interneurons ) at the level of L4 in the spinal cord , completely independent of higher centres . From there , an alpha motor neuron conducts an efferent impulse back to the quadriceps femoris muscle , triggering contraction . This contraction , coordinated with the relaxation of the antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle causes the leg to kick . This reflex is a reflex of proprioception which helps maintain posture and balance , allowing to keep one 's balance with little effort or conscious thought . \n \n The patellar reflex is a clinical and classic example of the monosynaptic reflex arc . There is no interneuron in the pathway leading to contraction of the quadriceps muscle . Instead the bipolar sensory neuron synapses directly on a motor neuron in the spinal cord . However , there is an inhibitory interneuron used to relax the antagonistic hamstring muscle ( Reciprocal innervation ) . \n \n This test of a basic automatic reflex may be influenced by the patient consciously inhibiting or exaggerating the response ; the doctor may use the Jendrassik maneuver as a distraction or diversion in order to ensure a more valid reflex test . \n \n Purpose of testing \n \n After the tap of a hammer , the leg is normally extended once and comes to rest . The absence or decrease of this reflex is problematic , and known as Westphal 's sign . This reflex may be diminished or absent in lower motor neuron lesions and during sleep . On the other hand , multiple oscillation of the leg ( pendular reflex ) following the tap may be a sign of cerebellar diseases . Exaggerated ( brisk ) deep tendon reflexes such as this can be found in upper motor neuron lesions , [ http : //www.utmb.edu/pedi_ed/CORE/Endocrine/page_32.htm hyperthyroidism ] , anxiety or nervousness . The test itself assesses the nervous tissue between and including the L2 and L4 segments of the spinal cord . \n \n History \n \n The term knee-jerk was recorded by Sir Michael Foster in his Textbook of physiology in 1877 : `` Striking the tendon below the patella gives rise to a sudden extension of the leg , known as the knee-jerk . `` [ http : //www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/220600.html Knee-jerk reaction ] \n \n Popular culture \n \n The term began to be used figuratively from the early 20th century onwards . O. O. McIntyre , in his New York Day-By-Day column in The Coshocton Tribune , October 1921 , wrote : `` Itinerant preacher stemming Broadway on a soap box . And gets only an occasional knee-jerk .

According to the US Apple Association website it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States . It remains popular for its glossy red fruit and for its utility in cooking . \n \n Characteristics \n \n The 'Rome ' is rounded , all red , and very glossy , with a thick skin and firm flesh . It is primarily used for baking , as its flavor develops when cooked , and it holds its shape well . It is commonly described as less desirable as an eating apple because of its subtle flavor that is not as sweet , flashy , or tart as some other varieties . It comes to market in late September and is considered a good keeper . 'Rome ' apples are widely grown and available , and are a staple variety in American commerce . \n \n Origins \n \n The story is given that in 1817 Joel Gillet ( also spelled `` Gillett '' or `` Gillette '' by his descendants ) found a tree in a shipment from a nursery that did not match the others ; he gave it to his son Alanson , saying , `` Here ’ s a Democrat . You may have this one . '' His son planted the tree on the banks of the Ohio River , where several years later it was found producing red fruit . His cousin , Horatio Nelson Gillett took cuttings and started a nursery to promote the apple . Originally known as 'Gillett 's Seedling ' , it was renamed the 'Rome Beauty ' in 1832 in honor of the township . The original tree survived into the 1850s until it was felled by erosion of the river bank . \n \n Proctorville , Ohio , which lies in the township , styles itself the `` Home of the Rome Beauty Apple '' . \n \n Disease susceptibility \n \n * Scab : high \n * Powdery mildew : high \n * Cedar-apple rust : high \n * Fire blight : high",

          "context": "`` Gunga Din '' is a 1892 poem by Rudyard Kipling , set in British India . It was the inspiration for a 1939 film of the same title . \n \n Background \n \n The poem is a rhyming narrative from the point of view of an English soldier in India , about an Indian water-bearer ( a bhishti ) who saves the soldier 's life but is soon shot and killed . In the final three lines , the soldier regrets the abuse he dealt to Din and admits that Din is the better man of the two . The poem was published as one of the set of martial poems called the Barrack-Room Ballads . \n \n In contrast to Kipling 's later poem `` The White Man 's Burden '' , `` Gunga Din '' is named after the Indian , portraying him as a heroic character who is not afraid to face danger on the battlefield as he tends to wounded men . The English soldiers who order Din around and beat him for not bringing them water fast enough are presented as being callous and shallow , and ultimately inferior to him . \n \n Although `` Din '' is frequently pronounced to rhyme with `` pin '' , the rhymes within the poem make it clear that it should be pronounced to rhyme with `` green '' . \n \n Adaptations \n \n The poem inspired a 1939 adventure film of the same name from RKO Radio Pictures starring Cary Grant , Victor McLaglen , Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , Joan Fontaine , and Sam Jaffe in the title role . The movie was remade in 1961 as Sergeants 3 , starring the Rat Pack . The locale was moved from British-colonial India to the old West . The Gunga Din character was played in this film by Sammy Davis , Jr .. Many elements of the 1939 film were also incorporated into Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom . \n \n In 1958 , Bobby Darin wrote and recorded the song `` That 's the Way Love Is '' in which , referring to the unsolved riddle of love , he sings `` And if ya come up with the answer , You 're a better man , sir , than I … Gunga Din '' .",

          "context": "`` The Female of the Species '' is a poem by Rudyard Kipling originally published in 1911 . The title and refrain has been used as a title for at least three other works ( see The Female of the Species ( disambiguation ) ) . \n \n Analysis \n \n It begins with illustrations of the greater deadliness of the females of different species , the Himalayan bear , the cobra and the native American , who frightened the Jesuits more than the men . It continues with the general thought that women , `` must be deadlier than the male '' , as she is formed for the one purpose - motherhood . Woman , says Kipling , has the greater determination - the greater courage and single-mindedness in the pursuit of the important in life . \n \n References in other media \n \n The Female of the Species and its refrain have been used as a catchphrase in other works . In 1928 the Bulldog Drummond story : The Female of the Species may have lifted the title . This story was adapted as the 1967 European spy movie Deadlier Than the Male . Scott Walker of the Walker Brothers wrote and performed the accompanying musical theme and scored a minor hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1966 . In 1996 the English pop group Space released `` Female of the Species '' . The title was again lifted in 2006 for Joanna Murray-Smith 's satirical play The Female of the Species . A 1946 novel by James Hadley Chase was titled More Deadly Than The Male . \n \n In 1984 , Off Centaur Publications released an audio tape cassette album titled The Horse-Tamer 's Daughter featuring a song based on the poem , set to music by Leslie Fish and performed by Julia Ecklar . In 1998 , the song was nominated for a Pegasus Award for `` Best Adaptation '' by a ballot of science fiction and fantasy fans , conducted by the committee of the annual Ohio Valley Filk Fest ( OVFF ) , a filk music convention . \n \n It is recited by the character of Denis Thatcher , played by Jim Broadbent , in the The Iron Lady ( 2011 ) . \n \n It is referenced by the character of Col. Mustard , played by Martin Mull , in the film `` Clue '' ( 1985 ) .",

These machines were created by the Food Display Machine Corporation in Chicago , Illinois , U.S. , around the 1920s and possibly later . \n \n History \n \n The Food Display Machine Corporation was located at 500 North Dearborn Street in Chicago . Its president was H. Adams . In the mid-1920s , through advertisements in Popular Mechanics magazine and perhaps other means as well , these machines were marketed as a way to start a small business . The machine ’ s manual has 3 parts : \n # Seven Proven Business Plans for Operating a Successful BROWN BOBBY Business \n # How to get the Best Results from your BROWN BOBBY Machine \n # Recipes that Whet the Buying Appetite \n The seven business plans described are : \n # Selling Direct to Homes \n # Getting the Restaurant and Drug Store Business \n # Getting the Grocery Business \n # Window Demonstrating and Sampling \n # Getting the Student Trade \n # Selling Through Salesmen \n # Running a BROWN BOBBY Store of your own \n \n Some of the suggested locations for selling included candy stores , theatres , chain stores , bowling alleys , cigar stores , railway stations , dance halls , waiting rooms , garages , filling stations , general stores , and soft drink parlors . \n \n One could also obtain boxes and bags from the company for packaging the doughnuts . The machines are no longer manufactured as the Food Display Machine Corporation has long been out of business . According to the [ http : //www.ftc.gov/os/annualreports/ar1937.pdf Annual Report of the Federal Trade Commission for 1937 ] the company was issued a Cease and Desist order for misrepresenting possible or maximum earnings for its potato chip machines . \n \n The machine \n \n The Brown Bobby machine resembled and operated similar to a waffle iron . Its surfaces were made of aluminium and were prepared for baking by coating with paraffin , though users today would most often use cooking spray . The machine had a high ( 600 watt/surfaces connected in parallel ) and a low ( 300 watt/surfaces connected in series ) setting . Cooking was done on the high setting , the low setting was for allowing the machine to remain idle . Machines were available as either a single ( aka Brown Bobby Junior ) for US $ 52 or as two machines riveted together into a single unit for US $ 100 . Since these machines are no longer manufactured they are prized by their owners and often handed down to subsequent generations to continue a tradition of Brown Bobby making , especially during the holidays . \n \n The doughnuts \n \n The Brown Bobby manual included 10 recipes for doughnuts , 4 icing recipes and a number of prepared doughnut mixes were also available . Recipes included Plain , Wholewheat , Bran , Spice , Nut , Tutti-Frutti , Chocolate and Oatmeal . The doughnuts were touted as “ greaseless ” because they were not deep-fried , but as the included recipe indicates , there was an amount of fat in the doughnut itself .",

Members of the genus are commonly known as Mexican orange or mock orange due to the similarity of their flowers with those of the closely related orange , both in shape and scent . They are native to southern North America , from Arizona , New Mexico , Texas and south through most of Mexico . In its generic name Humboldt and Bonpland honoured Swiss botanist Jacques Denis Choisy ( 1799-1859 ) . \n \n Description \n \n The species grow to 1 - tall . The leaves are opposite , leathery , glossy , palmately compound with 3-13 leaflets , each leaflet 3 - long and broad . C. ternata has three broad leaflets , while C. dumosa has up to 13 very narrow leaflets . The flowers are star-shaped , 3 - diameter , with 4-7 white petals , 8-15 stamens and a green stigma ; they are produced throughout the late spring and summer . The fruit is a leathery two to six sectioned capsule . \n \n Uses \n \n Choisya species are popular ornamental plants in areas with mild winters , grown primarily for their abundant and fragrant flowers . The foliage is also aromatic , smelling of rue when bruised or cut . The most commonly found cultivars in the horticultural trade are the species , C. ternata , the golden-leaved C. ternata 'Sundance ' , and the inter-specific hybrid C. 'Aztec Pearl ' ( C. dumosa var . arizonica × C. ternata ) . All three varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden Merit . \n \n The flowers are also valued for honeybee forage , producing abundant nectar . \n \n Chemistry \n \n Many quinoline alkaloids have been isolated from leaves of Choisya ternata . C. ternata contains an alkaloid ( ternanthranin ) , a volatile simple anthranilate that can be considered responsible for the antinociceptive activity of the crude plant extracts . \n \n Species \n \n * Choisya dumosa ( Torr . ) A.Gray ( includes C. arizonica ) – starleaf \n * Choisya katherinae C.H.Müll . \n * Choisya neglecta C.H.Müll . \n * Choisya palmeri Standl . \n * Choisya ternata Kunth – Mexican orange blossom \n \n Pests and diseases \n \n Choisya can be prone to attack by pythium root rot , particularly when propagated and grown in pots for the horticultural trade . In north-west Europe the main pest is snails , which eat the bark of even mature specimens , resulting in minor die-back of branches where ring-barking has occurred .",

Written by band leader Jeff Christie , the song was offered to The Tremeloes , who recorded it with the intention of releasing it as a single early in 1970 . However , after the success of their then most recent single , `` Call Me Number One '' , and after considering it too pop-orientated for their future direction , they decided to follow it up with another of their own compositions , `` By The Way '' , which was only a minor Top 40 success . \n \n Producer Mike Smith therefore took their vocals off the recording and added those of Jeff Christie . Released on 23 April 1970 , it became an international hit , reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart for one week in June 1970 . In the US , it reached number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart . \n \n The actual location of Yellow River in this song is not specified , although the author , Jeff Christie , is on record as saying that it was inspired by the idea of a soldier going home at the end of the American Civil War . As the song was released during the Viet Nam War , it has been interpreted as being about a soldier leaving the US Military at the end of his period of conscription . \n \n Chart performance \n \n Other versions \n \n `` Yellow River '' has spawned a host of cover versions by artists as diverse as R.E.M. , Leapy Lee , Elton John , The Compton Brothers , Middle of the Road , Chris Rea and Joe Dassin ( who achieved a major hit with this French cover named L'Amérique ) . \n \n In Australia , Christie 's version of Yellow River gained only limited airplay due to the 1970 radio ban . Local bands Jigsaw from Melbourne and Autumn from Sydney both had success with cover versions .",

Written by White , Tony Sepe and Peter Radcliffe and produced by White , `` You 're the First , the Last , My Everything '' was White 's fourth top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart , reaching # 2 ; it spent a week at # 1 on the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart . The early disco classic made it to number two on the disco/dance charts . In the UK Singles Chart it fared even better , spending two weeks at the top in December 1974 . It appeared on White 's 1974 album Ca n't Get Enough . \n \n Radcliffe originally wrote `` You 're the First , My Last , My Everything '' as a country song with the title `` You 're My First , You 're My Last , My In-Between '' , which went unrecorded for 21 years . White recorded it as a disco song , keeping most of the structure and about two-third of the title , but he rewrote the lyrics . \n \n In popular culture \n \n The song is featured in the films Money Talks ( 1997 ; also on its CD soundtrack album , where White had recorded an alternative version , as simply `` My Everything '' as a duet with Faith Evans ) , Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason ( 2004 ; also on its CD soundtrack album ) , Zookeeper ( 2011 ) , and anachronistically in Tim Burton 's film Dark Shadows ( 2012 ; also on its CD soundtrack album ) as the film was set in 1972 , two years before the song was released . \n \n It was also in several episodes of the Fox series Ally McBeal , accompanying John Cage ( Peter MacNicol ) during his life most of the time . Whenever he gets into a difficult situation , he withdraws and concentrates on the song , hearing it and dancing to it , to regain strength and concentrate on whatever comes along . \n \n The song is featured in the music video game Just Dance 4 ( 2012 ) for PlayStation 3 , Wii , Wii U , and Xbox 360 . \n \n Chart positions \n \n Other notable recordings \n \n A cover version of the song performed by Howard Brown was released in 2005 in the UK as a charity single . It peaked at # 13 in the UK singles chart . Prior to its release it had been adapted for a popular television commercial for Halifax Bank in which Brown could be seen singing and dancing .",

Higgins goes along with it for the purposes of a wager : That he can turn her into the toast of elite London society . \n \n Doolittle receives voice coaching and learns the rules of etiquette . The outcome of these attentions varies between the original play and the various adaptations ( see Pygmalion article ) . \n \n History \n \n The part of Eliza was originally played by Mrs Patrick Campbell , at that time the most famous actress on the London stage but considered by many to be far too old for the role . The unprecedented use of the word `` bloody '' - as a scripted intensive - caused a sensation when Campbell delivered it . \n \n For the 1938 film Pygmalion , George Bernard Shaw personally requested the young English actress Wendy Hiller play Doolittle , a part she had previously played on stage opposite Leslie Howard as Higgins . Her performance served as the definitive film portrayal until Audrey Hepburn played the role in the highly successful 1964 film musical My Fair Lady . \n \n Julie Andrews originated the musical version of Doolittle on stage in My Fair Lady , with Rex Harrison as Higgins . Harrison went on to reprise his role in the 1964 film alongside Audrey Hepburn as Doolittle . At the 37th Academy Awards , the award for Best Actress went to Andrews for her performance as Mary Poppins . Hepburn was not nominated . Despite this , many critics greatly applauded Hepburn 's `` exquisite '' performance . [ http : //www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/5894883/Audrey-Hepburn.html Audrey Hepburn Obituary ] . Telegraph `` The happiest thing about [ My Fair Lady ] '' , wrote Bosley Crowther , `` is that Audrey Hepburn superbly justifies the decision of Jack Warner to get her to play the title role . '' Her co-star Rex Harrison , also called Hepburn his favourite leading lady and Gene Ringgold of Soundstage also commented that `` Audrey Hepburn is magnificent . She is Eliza for the ages , '' while adding , `` Everyone agreed that if Julie Andrews was not to be in the film , Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice . '' \n \n Martine McCutcheon played the role in the 2001 London revival of My Fair Lady . Despite missing many performances ( citing health problems ) , having to have various understudies perform the role and withdrawing nearly five months early from the production 's transfer to the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , she won the award for best actress in a musical at the 2002 Laurence Olivier Awards . One of the understudies was then-unknown `` First Lady of the West End '' Kerry Ellis .",

It is one of nine streets that converge at Bank . \n \n The street is famous as the site of the Bank of England ; the bank itself is sometimes known as 'the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street ' and has been based at its current location since 1734 . The London Stock Exchange was also situated on Threadneedle Street until 2004 , when it relocated to nearby Paternoster Square . The Baltic Exchange was founded in the on Threadneedle Street in 1744 ; it is now located on St Mary Axe . \n \n Etymology \n \n Some believe that the name originated as Three Needle Street ( first attested in 1598 ) , perhaps from a signboard portraying three needles , or from the three needles on the arms of needle-makers who had premises on the street . The threads and needles used by the members of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors is another possibility , since the livery company 's hall has been located on Threadneedle Street since 1347 . Before 1598 the road was part of Broad Street ( now Old Broad Street ) . \n \n Points of interest \n \n In addition to the Bank of England , there are a number of shops , banks , restaurants and offices located on Threadneedle Street . \n \n The Merchant Taylors ' Hall , home of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors , has occupied a site off Threadneedle Street since 1347 . It is said that it is here that the British national anthem was sung , in private , in 1607 for the first time , conducted by John Bull . \n \n The headquarters of the South Sea Company was located on the street from 1711 to the 1850s . \n \n The London office of the world 's oldest merchant bank , Berenberg Bank , is located at No . 60 . \n \n The nearest London Underground station is Bank . London 's first bus service ran between Threadneedle Street and Paddington from 1829 . Today , the street is served by bus routes 8 , 11 , 23 , 26 , 133 , 242 , and 388 . \n \n Over 5000 tonnes of gold bars are held by the Bank of England ( both official reserves of the UK Treasury , and others ) in a system of 8 vaults over two floors under Threadneedle Street .",

Thus , a fighter whose weight is over 200 lb ( 14 st 3 lb , 90 kg ) may not fight as anything but a heavyweight . \n \n Joe Louis holds the record for most consecutive title defenses at this division , with 25 defenses of the Universal title . This is also the record for most consecutive title defenses in boxing history . \n \n Historical development \n \n Because this division had no weight limit , it has been historically vaguely defined . In the 19th century , for example , many heavyweight champions weighed 170 pounds ( 12 st 2 lb , 77 kg ) or less ( although others weighed 200 pounds ) . \n \n The first heavyweight champion under the Marquess of Queensberry rules was John L. Sullivan , known as `` The Boston Strong Boy '' . He weighed around 200 pounds when in shape and was a bare-knuckle champion . He was defeated by Jim Corbett on September 7 , 1892 , in 21 rounds . \n \n In 1920 , the minimum weight for a heavyweight was set at 175 pounds ( 12 st 7 lb , 79 kg ) , which today is the light heavyweight division maximum . Since 1980 , for most boxing organizations , the maximum weight for a cruiserweight has been 200 pounds . \n \n Since the 1960s , the heavyweight title has become fractured amongst various sanctioning organizations , and so what was once known as the single `` Heavyweight Champion '' , is now referred to as the `` Undisputed Champion '' as the one fighter that has defeated all the other titlists . \n \n Professional champions \n \n Current champions \n \n Interim Champions \n \n Current Male Champions \n \n Longest reigning heavyweight champions \n \n Below is a list of longest reigning heavyweight champions in boxing measured by the individual 's longest reign . Career total time as champion ( for multiple time champions ) does not apply . \n \n Most wins in heavyweight title bouts \n \n Most consecutive heavyweight title defenses \n \n Active Title Reign \n Reign has ended \n \n Kickboxing \n \n * In kickboxing , a heavyweight fighter generally weighs between 88 kg ( 196 lb ) and 100 kg ( 220 lb ) . The Fighters over 100 kg ( 220 lb ) are considered super heavyweights . \n * International Kickboxing Federation ( IKF ) Heavyweight ( Pro & Amateur ) 215.1 – 235 lb . or 97.8 – 106.8 kg . \n * In Glory promotion , a heavyweight division is over 95 kg ( 209 lb ) and no upper weight limit . \n \n Mixed martial arts \n \n The heavyweight division in MMA generally groups fighters between 205 and 265 lb ( 93 and 120 kg ) . \n \n Analogous uses \n \n The word `` heavyweight '' is sometimes used in other fields ( e.g . politics ) to denote a person who is especially powerful or influential . In this context , `` big beast '' has a similar meaning . Other boxing analogies include `` punching above his [ their ] weight '' to denote a person or entity ( e.g . a country ) whose influence is arguably greater than his/its basic attributes would suggest .",

His stage name was taken from the bus conductor played by Ivor Cutler in the Beatles ' 1967 film Magical Mystery Tour . \n \n Biography \n \n Born in Stoke Newington as Douglas Woods to a single mother , Buster was adopted and brought up by his great-aunt Mary Trendle and her husband , Edward . He did not know he was adopted until the age of seven , when he overheard his adoptive mother talking to a neighbour . He discovered that the woman that he knew as 'Auntie Lily ' , was really his mother . He never met his father . \n \n He founded Bad Manners with friends at Woodberry Down Comprehensive School in North London in 1976 . Bad Manners were a popular live attraction in North London , with their brand of humorous ska making them comedians of the ska revival scene , with Buster often wagging his large tongue at his audiences . Bad Manners earned nine Top 40 singles between 1980 and 1983 , and the band have remained a popular live act throughout Britain and Europe ever since . \n \n However , the group originally split up in 1987 , after their contract with Portrait Records finished and he eventually formed a new outfit called Buster 's Allstars , performing at clubs and pubs in London , but he still played some concerts with Bad Manners at larger venues , along with some new musicians and a few other original band members . \n \n In 1988 , Buster licensed the Blue Beat Records name and logo , and he ran the record label from an old houseboat that was stationed in his back garden at his former home in Hackney . Blue Beat issued a number of releases , notably by Bad Manners , Napoleon Solo , Buster 's Allstars and the Billies , but the label folded in 1990 . \n \n Buster Bloodvessel also appeared in the films Out of Order and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid before landing a part in an episode of Boon in 1990 . In 1998 , he signed a solo deal with the Virgin Records offshoot label , Innocent Records , and recorded an album but the label decided to axe the project just before his debut solo single was to be released . \n \n Buster struggled with morbid obesity and underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery in 2004 , his weight dropping from 31 stone to 13 stone . He once owned a hotel in Margate called Fatty Towers , which specifically catered for larger customers , with features such as extra large beds and baths as well as fatty meals . The hotel closed in 1998 and Buster moved back to London . He often appears as a guest on various television shows , as well as in the tabloid newspapers . In early 2001 he fell ill during a concert in Perugia .",

He is best remembered for his double act with Bud Flanagan , Flanagan and Allen . \n \n Life and career \n \n He was born William Ernest Chesney Allen in Battersea , London , married Aleta Cosette Turner in Leeds in 1926 and died in Midhurst , Sussex , England . \n \n He began his career in straight acting , making his debut in stock at the Wimbledon Theatre , London , in 1912 . Serving in Flanders in the First World War , he made friends with Bud Flanagan , and worked with him from 1924 . As music hall comedians , they would often feature a mixture of comedy and music in their act and this led to a successful recording career and roles in film and television . Flanagan and Allen were also members of the Crazy Gang and worked together in that team for many years . \n \n Flanagan and Allen 's songs featured the same , usually gentle humour for which the duo were known in their live performances , and during the war reflected the experiences of ordinary people during wartime . Songs like `` We 're Going to Hang Out the Washing on the Siegfried Line '' mocked the German defences ( Siegfried Line ) , while others like `` Miss You '' sang of missing one 's sweetheart during enforced absences . Other songs such as their best known `` Underneath the Arches '' ( which Flanagan co-wrote with Reg Connelly ) had universal themes such as friendship , which again , helped people relate to the subject matter . The music was usually melodic , following a binary verse–verse–chorus structure , with a small dance band or orchestra providing the backing . The vocals were distinctive because while Flanagan was at least a competent singer and sang the melody lines , Allen used an almost spoken delivery to provide the harmonies . \n \n Flanagan and Allen stopped performing together with Chesney Allen 's retirement on health grounds in the late 1950s following the penultimate season of the Crazy Gang 's show at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London ( His place for the final season was taken by 'Monsewer ' Eddie Gray ) , although he continued working in theatrical management and returned to make occasional guest appearances . His last recording was for the album of the stage show Underneath the Arches in 1982 . \n \n Chesney Hawkes is named after Chesney Allen . \n \n Selected filmography \n \n * O-Kay for Sound ( 1937 ) \n * Alf 's Button Afloat ( 1938 ) \n * Dunkirk ( 1958 ) \n * Life Is a Circus ( 1960 )",

It is run at Newbury over a distance of about 3 miles and 2½ furlongs ( 5,331 metres ) , and during its running there are twenty-one fences to be jumped . It is a handicap race , and it is scheduled to take place each year in late November or early December . \n \n History \n \n The event was established in 1957 , and it was initially staged at Cheltenham . The winner of the inaugural running , Mandarin , was owned by Peggy Hennessy , a member of the family which founded Hennessy , the race 's sponsoring company . It was transferred to Newbury in 1960 , and it was won by Mandarin for a second time in 1961 . The race 's second running was won by Taxidermist , ridden by the amateur rider John Lawrence , later Lord Oaksey , who was the breeder and part-owner of the 2011 winner , Carruthers . \n \n The race 's association with Hennessy has continued throughout its history , and this now represents British racing 's longest commercial sponsorship . The record was previously held by the Whitbread Gold Cup , which was first run seven months before the `` Hennessy '' , and which was sponsored by Whitbread until 2001 . \n \n The Hennessy Gold Cup has been won by eight horses which have also achieved victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup . The most recent of these is Bobs Worth , the winner of the latter race in 2013 . \n \n Many Clouds became the first horse to win both the Hennessy Gold Cup and the Grand National , in 2014 and 2015 respectively . \n \n Records \n \n Most successful horse ( 2 wins ) : \n * Mandarin – 1957 , 1961 \n * Arkle – 1964 , 1965 \n * Denman – 2007 , 2009 \n \n Leading jockey ( 3 wins ) : \n * Willie Robinson – Mandarin ( 1961 ) , Mill House ( 1963 ) , Man of the West ( 1968 ) \n \n Leading trainer ( 7 wins ) : \n * Fulke Walwyn – Mandarin ( 1957 , 1961 ) , Taxidermist ( 1958 ) , Mill House ( 1963 ) , Man of the West ( 1968 ) , Charlie Potheen ( 1972 ) , Diamond Edge ( 1981 ) \n \n Winners \n \n * Weights given in stones and pounds ; Amateur jockeys indicated by `` Mr '' . \n \n Be My Royal finished first in 2002 , but he was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for a banned substance .",

Impatiens sultanii ) , also known as busy Lizzie ( United Kingdom ) , balsam , sultana , or simply impatiens , is a species of the genus Impatiens , native to eastern Africa from Kenya to Mozambique . It is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant growing to 15 - tall , with broad lanceolate leaves 3–12 cm long and 2–5 cm broad . Leaves are mostly alternate , although they may be opposite near the top of the plant . The flowers are profusely borne , 2–5 cm diameter , with five petals and a 1 cm spur . The seedpod explodes when ripe in the same manner as other Impatiens species , an evolutionary adaptation for seed dispersal . The stems are semi-succulent , and all parts of the plant ( leaves , stems , flowers , roots ) are soft and easily damaged . \n \n Cultivation \n \n Although perennial in frost-free growing conditions , it is usually treated as a half-hardy annual in temperate regions ( though pot-grown plants can be successfully overwintered indoors ) . It is commonly cultivated in parks and gardens , typically grown in containers but also in bedding schemes . Propagation is by seed or stem cuttings ( which often root readily in water ) . Numerous cultivars in a range of colours from white to purple , are widely available commercially , either as seeds or young plants . They include the following : - \n \n Super Elfin series is the dominantly available commercial cultivar group . This group of impatiens was bred by Claude Hope in Costa Rica . Mr. Hope developed this species from its native wild form into one of the most popular bedding plants in the world . \n \n Pests and diseases \n \n Impatiens downy mildew has spread widely in recent years and has seriously damaged the commercial production of I. walleriana hybrids .",

          "context": "An impresario ( from the Italian impresa , 'an enterprise or undertaking ' ) is a person who organizes and often finances concerts , plays or operas , performing a role similar to that of an artist manager or a film or television producer . The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera , in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s , the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season . The owners of the theatre , usually noble amateurs , charged the impresario with hiring a composer ( until the 1850s operas were expected to be new ) and the orchestra , singers , costumes and sets , all while assuming considerable financial risk . In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor ( The Impresario ) . Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer ; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice , where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others . \n \n Alessandro Lanari ( 1787–1852 ) , who began as the owner of a shop that produced costumes , eliminated the middleman in a series of successful seasons he produced for the Teatro La Pergola , in Florence , which presented the premieres of the first version of Verdi 's Macbeth , two of Bellini 's operas and five of Donizetti 's , including Lucia di Lammermoor . Domenico Barbaia ( 1778–1841 ) began as a café waiter and made a fortune at La Scala , in Milan , where he was also in charge of the gambling operation and introduced roulette . \n \n Modern use \n \n The traditional term is still used in the entertainment industry to refer to a producer of concerts , tours and other events in music , opera , theatre and even rodeo . Important modern impresarios in the traditional sense include Thomas Beecham , Rudolf Bing , Sergei Diaghilev , Richard D'Oyly Carte , Fortune Gallo , Sol Hurok , Aaron Richmond , and jazz festival producer George Wein . \n \n Application of term \n \n The term is occasionally applied to others , such as independent art museum curators and conference organizers who have a leading role in orchestrating events . \n \n Figurative impresarios \n \n Jacques-Yves Cousteau said of himself that he was an impresario of scientists as an explorer and filmmaker who worked with scientists in underwater exploration . Nicholas Wade described James D. Watson and E. O. Wilson in The New York Times as impresarios of Charles Darwin 's works .",

The lake is both fed and drained by the River Rothay , which flows through the village before entering the lake , and then exits downstream into nearby Rydal Water , beyond which it continues into Windermere.Parker , 2004 , page 90 \n \n The waters of the lake are leased by the Lowther Estate to the National Trust . The waters are navigable , with private boats allowed and rowing boats for hire , but powered boats are prohibited . The lake contains a single island , known as The Island . \n \n Etymology \n \n `` 'The lake flanked by grass ' ; 'gres ' , 'mere ' . Early spellings in 'Grys- ' , 'Gris ( s ) - ' might suggest ON 'griss ' 'young pig ' as 1st el . [ ement ] , but the weight of the evidence points to OE/ON 'gres ' 'grass ' , with the modern form influenced by Standard English .... The medial '-s ( s ) e- ' may , as suggested by Ekwall in DEPN , point to ON 'gres-saer ' 'grass-lake ' as the original name ... '' . Plus the element `` 'mere ' OE , ModE 'lake , 'pool ' '' . \n \n ( OE is Old English up to around AD 1100 ; ON is Old Norse . )",

          "context": "A century ( from the Latin centum , meaning one hundred ; abbreviated c. ) is 100 years . Centuries are numbered ordinally in the English language along with many others ( e.g . `` the 7th century AD/CE '' ) . A centenary is a hundredth anniversary or a celebration of this , typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier . Its adjectival form is centennial . \n \n Start and end in the Gregorian Calendar \n \n According to the Gregorian calendar , the 1st century AD/CE started on January 1 , 1 , and ended on December 31 , 100 . The 2nd century started at year 101 , the 3rd at 201 , etc . The n-th century started/will start on the year ( 100 × n ) − 99 and ends in 100 × n. A century will only include one year , the centennial year , that starts with the century 's number ( e.g . 1900 is the final year of the 19th century ) . \n \n 1st century BC and AD \n \n There is no `` zeroth century '' in between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD . Also , there is no year 0 AD . The Julian calendar `` jumps '' from 1 BC to 1 AD . The first century BC includes the years 100 BC to 1 BC . Other centuries BC follow the same pattern . \n \n Dating units in other calendar systems \n \n Besides the Gregorian calendar , the Julian calendar , the Aztec calendar , and the Hindu calendar have cycles of years that are used to delineate whole time periods ; the Hindu calendar , in particular , summarizes its years into groups of 60 , while the Aztec calendar considers groups of 52 . \n \n Centuries in astronomical year numbering \n \n Astronomical year numbering , used by astronomers , includes a year zero ( 0 ) . Consequently , the 1st century in these calendars may designate the years 0 to 99 as the 1st century , years 100 to 199 as the second , etc . Therefore , in order to regard 2000 as the first year of the 21st century according to the astronomical year numbering , the astronomical year 0 has to correspond to the Gregorian year 1 BC . \n \n Alternative naming systems \n \n In Swedish , Danish , Norwegian , Icelandic and Finnish , besides the ordinal naming of centuries another system is often used based on the hundreds part of the year , and consequently centuries start at even multiples of 100 . For example , Swedish nittonhundratalet ( or 1900-talet ) , Danish nittenhundredetallet ( or 1900-tallet ) , Norwegian nittenhundretallet ( or 1900-tallet ) and Finnish tuhatyhdeksänsataaluku ( or 1900-luku ) refer unambiguously to the years 1900–1999 . \n \n The same system is used informally in English . For example , the years 1900–1999 are sometimes referred to as the nineteen hundreds ( 1900s ) . This is similar to the English decade names ( 1980s , meaning the years 1980–1989 ) .",

Stuffed fresh and roasted it is popular in chile rellenos poblanos . \n \n While poblanos tend to have a mild flavor , occasionally and unpredictably they can have significant heat . Different peppers from the same plant have been reported to vary substantially in heat intensity . The ripened red poblano is significantly hotter and more flavorful than the less ripe , green poblano . \n \n A closely related variety is the mulato , which is darker in color , sweeter in flavor , and softer in texture . \n \n Growth \n \n The bush has multiple stems and can reach 25 in in height . The fruit is 3 to long and 2 to wide . An immature poblano is dark purplish green in color , but the mature fruits eventually turn a red so dark as to be nearly black . \n \n Poblanos grow in zones 10–12 and do best with a soil pH between 7.0 and 8.5 . They typically prefer full sunlight and may require additional support for the growing fruits during harvest in late summer . A poblano takes around 200 days from seed to harvest and requires soil temperatures of at least 64 °F ( 18 °C ) to germinate . \n \n Use \n \n Preparation methods include : dried , coated in whipped egg ( capeado ) and fried , stuffed , or in mole sauces . It is particularly popular during the Mexican independence festivities as part of a dish called chiles en nogada , which incorporates green , white , and red ingredients corresponding to the colors of the Mexican flag . This may be considered one of Mexico 's most symbolic dishes by its nationals . It is also usually used in the widely found dish chile relleno . Poblanos are popular in the United States and can be found in grocery stores in the states bordering Mexico and in urban areas . \n \n After being roasted and peeled ( which improves the texture by removing the waxy skin ) , poblano peppers are preserved by either canning or freezing . Storing them in airtight containers keeps them for several months . When dried , the poblano becomes a broad , flat , heart-shaped pod ; from this form , it is often ground into a powder used as flavoring in various dishes . \n \n `` Poblano '' is also the word for an inhabitant of Puebla , and mole poblano refers to the spicy chocolate chili sauce originating in Puebla . \n \n Gallery \n \n \n Image : PasillaKnife.jpg|A fresh poblano chile , sometimes incorrectly referred to as pasilla north of Mexico \n Image : Capsicum annuum ancho dried.jpg|A dried poblano is called a `` chile ancho ''",

Found mainly in the Caribbean islands , it is also in Guyana ( where it is called the ball-of-fire pepper ) , the Maldives Islands ( where it is called mirus ) , Panama ( Where it is called `` Aji Chombo '' ) and West Africa . Most Scotch bonnets have a heat rating of 100,000–350,000 Scoville units . For comparison , most jalapeño peppers have a heat rating of 2,500 to 8,000 on the Scoville scale . However there are completely sweet varieties of Scotch bonnet grown on some of the Caribbean islands , called cachucha peppers . \n \n These peppers are used to flavour many different dishes and cuisines worldwide and are often used in hot sauces and condiments . The Scotch bonnet has a sweeter flavour and stouter shape , distinct from its habanero cousin with which it is often confused , and gives jerk dishes ( pork/chicken ) and other Caribbean dishes their unique flavour . Scotch bonnets are mostly used in West African , Antiguan , Kittitian , Anguilan , Dominican , St. Lucian and St Vincentian , Grenadian , Trinidadian , Jamaican , Barbadian , Guyanese , Surinamese , Haitian and Cayman cuisine and pepper sauces , though they often show up in other Caribbean recipes . It 's also used in other countries like Costa Rica and Panama ( Where it is called `` Aji Chombo '' ) for caribbean-styled recipes such as `` Rice and Peas '' , `` Rondon '' , `` Saus '' , `` Beef Patties '' and also `` Ceviches '' . \n \n Fresh , ripe scotch bonnets change from green to colours ranging from yellow to scarlet red . \n \n File : HotPeppersinMarket.jpg|Scotch bonnet peppers in a Caribbean market \n File : A Scotch Bonnet.jpg|A single ripe Scotch bonnet pepper",

After becoming friendly with some of the other creatures inhabiting the garden , Rikki is warned of two cobras Nag and Nagaina , who are angered by the family 's presence on their territory . Accordingly Nag enters the house 's bathroom before dawn but is attacked by Rikki . The struggle that ensues awakens the human family and the father kills Nag with a shotgun . \n \n The grieving Nagaina attempts revenge against Rikki 's humans , cornering them as they have breakfast on an outdoor veranda . While Nagaina is distracted by a female tailor bird Rikki destroys the cobra 's unhatched brood of eggs except for one . He carries it to where Nagaina is threatening to bite the child Teddy while his parents watch helplessly . Nagaina , enraged , recovers her egg , but is pursued by Rikki-Tikki away from the house to the cobra 's underground nest where an unseen final battle takes place . Rikki emerges triumphant from the hole declaring Nagaina dead . His subsequent role is to protect the family by keeping the garden free from any future intrusion by snakes . \n \n Film adaptations \n \n In 1965 in the Soviet Union , at the film studio `` Soyuzmultfilm '' , the director Aleksandra Snezhko-Blotskaya shot an animated short of the story entitled Рикки тикки тави ( Rikki-Tikki-Tavi ) . Later , Aleksandr Zguridi and Nana Kldiashvili directed a live-action feature film in 1975 entitled Rikki-Tikki-Tavi . That same year , animator Chuck Jones adapted the story for a half-hour TV special in the United States . \n \n In music \n \n Two songs titled `` Rikki Tikki Tavi '' are : \n * Donovan 's `` Rikki Tikki Tavi '' on his 1970 album Open Road , in which Donovan compares the little mongoose to large institutions , such as the church and the government . \n * '' Rikki Tikki Tavi '' is a song by alternative metal band Fair To Midland on their 2011 album Arrows and Anchors .",

It was the inspiration for a 1939 film of the same title . \n \n Background \n \n The poem is a rhyming narrative from the point of view of an English soldier in India , about an Indian water-bearer ( a bhishti ) who saves the soldier 's life but is soon shot and killed . In the final three lines , the soldier regrets the abuse he dealt to Din and admits that Din is the better man of the two . The poem was published as one of the set of martial poems called the Barrack-Room Ballads . \n \n In contrast to Kipling 's later poem `` The White Man 's Burden '' , `` Gunga Din '' is named after the Indian , portraying him as a heroic character who is not afraid to face danger on the battlefield as he tends to wounded men . The English soldiers who order Din around and beat him for not bringing them water fast enough are presented as being callous and shallow , and ultimately inferior to him . \n \n Although `` Din '' is frequently pronounced to rhyme with `` pin '' , the rhymes within the poem make it clear that it should be pronounced to rhyme with `` green '' . \n \n Adaptations \n \n The poem inspired a 1939 adventure film of the same name from RKO Radio Pictures starring Cary Grant , Victor McLaglen , Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , Joan Fontaine , and Sam Jaffe in the title role . The movie was remade in 1961 as Sergeants 3 , starring the Rat Pack . The locale was moved from British-colonial India to the old West . The Gunga Din character was played in this film by Sammy Davis , Jr .. Many elements of the 1939 film were also incorporated into Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom . \n \n In 1958 , Bobby Darin wrote and recorded the song `` That 's the Way Love Is '' in which , referring to the unsolved riddle of love , he sings `` And if ya come up with the answer , You 're a better man , sir , than I … Gunga Din '' .",

In return for donated land , the railroad granted to Nick Hodges the naming rights . He selected `` Kingston '' in honor of the location where his Confederate unit had surrendered . The population increase was so rapid that before the end of 1880 the community had a post office . A newspaper named the Kingston Beacon was begun two years later . At the very end of the century a college was located in town . By 1890 the population had reached 600 individuals and boasted several commercial and social establishments , but it began to decline after the town refused a bonus to the Gulf , Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in order to bring that rail line through the town . By 1914 the population had halved . The post office was shut down in 1930 . By 1947 the population had halved again , bringing down the total to 150 . In 2000 the population of Kingston was 140 .",

Found mainly in the Caribbean islands , it is also in Guyana ( where it is called the ball-of-fire pepper ) , the Maldives Islands ( where it is called mirus ) , Panama ( Where it is called `` Aji Chombo '' ) and West Africa . Most Scotch bonnets have a heat rating of 100,000–350,000 Scoville units . For comparison , most jalapeño peppers have a heat rating of 2,500 to 8,000 on the Scoville scale . However there are completely sweet varieties of Scotch bonnet grown on some of the Caribbean islands , called cachucha peppers . \n \n These peppers are used to flavour many different dishes and cuisines worldwide and are often used in hot sauces and condiments . The Scotch bonnet has a sweeter flavour and stouter shape , distinct from its habanero cousin with which it is often confused , and gives jerk dishes ( pork/chicken ) and other Caribbean dishes their unique flavour . Scotch bonnets are mostly used in West African , Antiguan , Kittitian , Anguilan , Dominican , St. Lucian and St Vincentian , Grenadian , Trinidadian , Jamaican , Barbadian , Guyanese , Surinamese , Haitian and Cayman cuisine and pepper sauces , though they often show up in other Caribbean recipes .

They were invented by John Lloyd Wright , second son of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright . Lincoln Logs were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 1999 . As of 2014 Lincoln Logs are manufactured by K'NEX Industries Inc . \n \n Design \n \n The logs measure three quarters of an inch ( roughly two centimetres ) in diameter . Analogous to real logs used in a log cabin , Lincoln Logs are notched so that logs may be laid at right angles to each other to form rectangles resembling buildings . Additional parts of the toy set include roofs , chimneys , windows and doors , which bring a realistic appearance to the final creation . Later sets included animals and human figures the same scale as the buildings . \n \n The toy sets were originally made of redwood , with varying colors of roof pieces . In the 1970s the company unsuccessfully introduced sets made entirely of plastic , but soon reverted to real wood . \n \n History \n \n Lincoln Logs were invented sometime around 1916-1917 when John Lloyd Wright was working in Japan with his father . The mold for the toy was based on the architecture of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo , designed by the inventor 's father . The foundation of the hotel was designed with interlocking log beams , which made the structure `` earthquake-proof '' . \n \n When he returned to the US , John organized The Red Square Toy Company ( named after his father 's famous symbol ) , and marketed the toy in 1918 . Wright was issued U.S. patent 1,351,086 on August 31 , 1920 , for a `` Toy-Cabin Construction '' . Soon after , he changed the name to J. L. Wright Manufacturing . The original Lincoln Log set came with instructions on how to build Uncle Tom 's Cabin as well as Abraham Lincoln 's cabin . Subsequent sets were larger and more elaborate . The toy was a hit , following as it did Meccano , Tinker Toys and Erector Set introduced a few years before . \n \n K'Nex , the toy 's current distributor , states the product was named after Abraham Lincoln , 16th President of the United States , who was famously born in a log cabin , due to patriotism during World War I . Others attribute the name to Frank Lloyd Wright 's original name , Frank Lincoln Wright , or the alteration of the name , 'linkin ' logs . \n \n In 1999 Lincoln Logs and John Lloyd Wright were entered into the National Toy Hall of Fame . In December 2014 the manufacturer announced the return of production from China to the US . \n \n Popular culture \n \n Lincoln Logs were used by Henry in the movie Mr. Magorium 's Wonder Emporium to quickly create a statue of President Lincoln himself .",

The northern part is in the borough of Camden and the southern part in the City of Westminster . \n \n Notable sites on Drury Lane \n \n The street originated as an early medieval lane called Via de Aldwych , which probably connected St. Giles Leper Hospital with the fields of Aldwych Close , owned by the hospital but traditionally said to have been granted to the Danes as part of a peace treaty with Alfred the Great in Saxon times . It acquired its name from the Suffolk barrister Sir Robert Drury , who built a mansion called Drury House on the lane around 1500 . After the death in 1615 of his great-great-grandson , another Robert Drury , the property passed out of the family . It became the London house of the Earl of Craven , then a public house under the sign of his reputed mistress , the Queen of Bohemia . Subsequently the gardens and courtyards of the house were built over with rows of smallhouses . The remains of the house itself , which had been progressively demolished , were finally cleared in 1809 . By this time Drury Lane had become one of the worst slums in London , dominated by prostitution and gin palaces . The area was eventually cleared to make way for the developments of Kingsway and Aldwych . \n \n The term `` Drury Lane '' is often used to refer to the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , which has in different incarnations been located in Drury Lane since the 17th century , even though today the main entrance is on Catherine Street . Also in Drury Lane is the New London Theatre . \n \n 173 Drury Lane was the location of the first J Sainsbury store , now one of the UK 's largest retailers . The store was opened in 1869 . \n \n 191 Drury Lane was the location of the Workers ' Educational Society in 1847/48 . \n \n In popular culture \n \n The street Drury Lane is where The Muffin Man lives , as mentioned in the popular nursery rhyme , and where the harlot of William Hogarth 's A Harlot 's Progress practises her profession .",

This cut is taken from the plate which is the lower belly of the animal . In the past it was sometimes known as `` butcher 's steak '' , because butchers would often keep it for themselves rather than offer it for sale . \n \n Hanger steak resembles flank steak in texture and flavor . It is a vaguely V-shaped pair of muscles with a long , inedible membrane running down the middle . The hanger steak is usually the most tender cut on an animal , and is best marinated and cooked quickly over high heat ( grilled or broiled ) and served rare or medium rare to avoid toughness . \n \n Anatomically speaking , the hanger steak is the crura , or legs , of the diaphragm . The steak is said to `` hang '' from the diaphragm of the heifer or steer . The diaphragm is one muscle , commonly cut into two separate cuts of meat : the hanger steak , traditionally considered more flavorful , and the outer skirt steak , composed of tougher muscle from the dome of the diaphragm . The hanger is attached to the last rib and to the front of several of the lumbar vertebrae . The right side is larger and stronger than the left . \n \n Occasionally seen on menus as a `` bistro steak '' , hanger steak is also very traditional in Mexican cuisine , particularly in the north where it is known as arrachera , and is generally marinated , grilled and served with a squeeze of lime juice , guacamole , salsa , and tortillas to roll tacos . In South Texas this cut of beef is known as fajitas arracheras . It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as flap steak or flap meat , which is a distinctly different cut . \n \n The hanger steak has historically been more popular in Europe . In Britain it is referred to as `` skirt '' , which is not to be confused with the American skirt steak . In French it is known as the onglet , in Italian the lombatello , in Flanders the kroaie and in Spanish the solomillo de pulmón . \n \n Its U.S. meat-cutting classification is NAMP 140 . \n \n Image : Hanger-steak-raw-MCB.jpg|Marinated raw hanger steak ; note the grain of the muscle and the tough central membrane . \n Image : Hanger-steak-cooked-MCB.jpg|Presentation of grilled hanger steak ( with potato )",

Approximately 90 % of the Niagara River , after diversions for hydropower generation , flows over Horseshoe Falls . The remaining 10 % flows over the American Falls . It is located between Terrapin Point on Goat Island in the US state of New York , and Table Rock on the Ontario side of the falls . According to official U.S. Geological Survey maps ( see References [ 7 ] [ 8 ] below ) , approximately two-thirds of Horseshoe Falls is located in Ontario , Canada with the remaining one-third in New York , United States . \n \n Boundary controversies \n \n When the boundary line was determined in 1819 based on the Treaty of Ghent , the northeastern end of the Horseshoe Falls was in New York , United States , flowing around the Terrapin Rocks , which was once connected to Goat Island by a series of bridges . In 1955 the area between the rocks and Goat Island was filled in , creating Terrapin Point . In the early 1980s the United States Army Corps of Engineers filled in more land and built diversion dams and retaining walls to force the water away from Terrapin Point . Altogether 400 ft of the Horseshoe Falls was eliminated . Constant erosion indicates the boundary line will alter into the future . \n \n In October 2007 , the Horseshoe Falls was featured in a Disney produced video titled Welcome : Portraits of America , made for the United States Department of State and Department of Homeland Security to promote United States tourism . A controversy surrounded the film , because instead of showing just the American falls and Bridal Veil Falls , they focused on Horseshoe Falls , which lies mostly , though not all , in Canada . \n \n Current ( 2014 ) online promotional materials from the Niagara Falls State Park , including the interactive map of the State Park , show the part of the Horseshoe Falls that is in U.S. territory , as determined by U.S. Geological Survey maps . This presentation of only part of Horseshoe Falls reflects a more accurate depiction of the boundaries of Niagara Falls State Park and U.S. territory . These official maps show approximately one-third of the Horseshoe Falls lies within the U.S. ( New York State ) , while approximately two-thirds of the Horseshoe Falls lies on the Canadian side ( province of Ontario ) . Scientists indicate Horseshoe Falls will continue to erode , thus altering future U.S.-Canadian boundaries . \n \n Both the 1995 map cited above and the new 2013 map of the U.S. Geological Survey indicate most of the Horseshoe Falls is in Canada , and both U.S. and New York State boundaries are shown on the newer map .",
